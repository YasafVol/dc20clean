### Character Creation Flow System Spec

#### Purpose
- Establish a canonical reference for the multi-stage character creation wizard so future specs (e.g., Level-Up) reuse the same structure and terminology
- Capture inputs, outputs, and validation rules per stage based on the React components in `src/routes/character-creation`
- Highlight data contracts with `characterContext` and `enhancedCharacterCalculator.ts`

#### Stage Contract
- Ordering is fixed: 1) Class & Features → 2) Ancestry → 3) Attributes → 4) Background → 5) Spells & Maneuvers → 6) Character Name
- State lives in `characterContext.tsx`; each stage must read/write through the reducer actions (`SET_CLASS`, `SET_TRAITS`, `UPDATE_SKILLS`, etc.)
- Validation gating: `CharacterCreation.tsx` calls `isStepCompleted(stepNumber)` before allowing navigation; each stage enforces completion via calculator outputs (ancestry/background budgets, attribute points remaining, spell counts)
- Calculator contract: `calculateCharacterWithBreakdowns(convertToEnhancedBuildData(state))` runs on every state change and returns:
  - `stats.finalAttributePoints`, `background`, `ancestry`, `breakdowns`, `validation`
  - `validation.errors` drive blocking messages (POINTS_OVERBUDGET, MASTERY_CAP_EXCEEDED)

#### Stage Details
- **Stage 1 – Class & Features** (`ClassSelector.tsx`, `ClassFeatures.tsx`)
  - Inputs: `classesData` (from `class.loader.ts`), `selectedFeatureChoices`, resolver-derived feature options (future)
  - Completion rule: class selected AND all required feature choices resolved (per `findClassByName` metadata)
  - Outputs: `state.classId`, `state.selectedFeatureChoices`
  - Dependencies: handles feature choice IDs; level selection will expand this stage without changing completion logic

- **Stage 2 – Ancestry** (`AncestrySelector.tsx`, `SelectedAncestries.tsx`)
  - Inputs: `traitsData`, calculator `ancestry.ancestryPointsRemaining`
  - Completion rule: at least one ancestry chosen, ancestry points ≥ 0, and remaining == 0
  - Outputs: `state.ancestry1Id`, `state.ancestry2Id`, `state.selectedTraitIds`, `state.selectedTraitChoices`

- **Stage 3 – Attributes** (`Attributes.tsx`)
  - Inputs: reducer state for each attribute, calculator `attributePointsRemaining`
  - Completion rule: remaining points == 0
  - Outputs: attribute values via `UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE`

- **Stage 4 – Background** (`Background.tsx`, `SkillsTab.tsx`, `TradesTab.tsx`, `LanguagesTab.tsx`)
  - Inputs: `state.skillsData`, `state.tradesData`, `state.languagesData`, calculator `background` budgets, mastery limits
  - Completion rule: skill points spent exactly, trade/language points <= remaining (UI allows overspend but completion requires <= 0 remaining)
  - Outputs: skills/trades/languages plus conversion values (`SET_CONVERSIONS`)

- **Stage 5 – Spells & Maneuvers** (`SpellsAndManeuvers.tsx`)
  - Inputs: `allSpells`, `allManeuvers`, class level progression (JSON today → resolver later), `state.selectedSpells`, `state.selectedManeuvers`
  - Completion rule: selected counts meet per-level requirements (cantrips + spells, maneuvers)
  - Outputs: `state.selectedSpells`, `state.selectedManeuvers`

- **Stage 6 – Character Name** (`CharacterName.tsx`)
  - Inputs: `state.finalName`, `state.finalPlayerName`
  - Completion rule: both fields non-empty
  - Outputs: final naming data for persistence

#### Level-Up WIP Stage (Planned)
- Activation: insert after Stage 1 when `state.level > 1`
- Inputs: resolver outputs (`talentBudget`, `pathBudget`, `pendingSubclassChoices`, unlocked feature list) exposed via `classProgressionResolver`
- Completion rule: all progress pools reduced to zero and every pending choice resolved; blockers surfaced via calculator validation (POINTS_OVERBUDGET for talents/path, unresolved choice prompts)
- Outputs: `state.talentSelections` (new), `state.pathInvestments`, `state.multiclassSelections`, plus persisted resolver confirmations so later stages display level-appropriate features
- UI notes: stage mirrors existing step gating (cannot advance until completion); error messaging should reuse Snackbar/step highlighting patterns
- Testing: add unit coverage for resolver budgets at level 2+ and integration tests that simulate completing Leveling Choices before entering Ancestry

#### Level-Up Stage UX Flow
- **Stage header**
  - Step rail marks the conditional “Level Up” slot; hover copy clarifies the stage appears when level > 1.
  - Two pill counters track budgets: `Talent selections X/Y`, `Path points X/Y`, toggling to warning colors when unspent.
- **Talent panel**
  - Accordion groups: General Talents (repeatable buttons), Class Talents (card list), Multiclass Talents (card list with prerequisite badges).
  - Selecting a repeatable option increments the counter; cards show a checkmark when picked, disabled tooltip when prerequisites fail.
  - Inline annotation reminds users they can take multiples of a general talent; we reflect that with a stackable chip UI.
- **Path panel**
  - Radio-style rows per path; each dot represents a point investment tier with descriptive text (e.g., “lvl 3: +1 stamina point +1 maneuvers +1 techniques”).
  - Special rule callout (Spellcaster Stamina) pinned beneath the Martial Path when two points allocated.
  - Summary shows current vs max investments; selecting a dot highlights unlocked benefits.
- **Feature picker**
  - Modal/inline panel lists classes → features; selecting a class reveals its feature cards with name, key benefits, and descriptive text.
  - Chosen feature surfaces as a chip and decrements relevant budgets.
- **Empty/parity states**
  - When no budgets remain, the accordion sections collapse and the stage shows a success banner.
  - Error state: counters turn amber, unresolved sections stay expanded with helper text (“Spend your remaining Path Point”).

#### Level-Up Stage Data Contract
- Calculator/resolver fields consumed:
  - `resolver.availableFeatures`: array of feature objects unlocked up to current level
  - `resolver.pendingChoices`: structured list of outstanding class/subclass/multiclass decisions with option payloads
  - `resolver.talentBudget`, `resolver.pathBudget`: numeric counters for remaining spends
  - `resolver.pathBenefits`: aggregated benefits after current investments (feeds preview UI)
  - `validation.errors`: reuse existing codes plus new `LEVELING_POINTS_UNSPENT`, `FEATURE_CHOICE_UNRESOLVED`
- Store actions/payloads:
  - `SET_LEVEL` (to be added) updates `state.level`
  - `SET_LEVELING_SELECTIONS` records `talentSelections`, `pathInvestments`, `multiclassSelections`
  - `CONFIRM_RESOLVED_CHOICES` commits resolver confirmations so subsequent stages treat them as unlocked
- Navigation gating relies on calculator validation; failure to resolve choices keeps the step marked incomplete.

#### State Extension Schema
| Store Field | Type | Source Stage | Description | Downstream Consumers |
|-------------|------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| `level` | number | Class & Features | User-selected target level (default 1) | Calculator, Leveling Choices, Spells/Maneuvers |
| `talentSelections` | `Record<string, string[]>` | Leveling Choices | Tracks chosen talents per tier/class | Background (for bonuses), final sheet |
| `pathInvestments` | `Record<'martial_path' \| 'spellcaster_path', number>` | Leveling Choices | Points allocated per path | Calculator path benefits, sheet display |
| `multiclassSelections` | `string[]` | Leveling Choices | Feature IDs chosen via multiclass talents | Calculator effects, features list |
| `resolvedFeatureIds` | `string[]` | Leveling Choices | Feature IDs unlocked after resolution | ClassFeatures recap, character sheet |
| `pendingFeatureChoices` | `Record<string, ChoiceState>` | Leveling Choices | Captures unresolved choices with option state | Leveling stage UI (until cleared) |
| `availableFeatures` | `FeatureSummary[]` | Resolver (read-only cache) | Snapshot of all features unlocked at level | Sheet, export, future UI |

> `ChoiceState` / `FeatureSummary` mirror resolver output types; define them in `characterContext.tsx` to keep serialization stable.

#### Validation Feedback Patterns
- Snackbar messaging: surface human-readable summaries (`"Spend remaining 1 Talent point"`, `"Choose a subclass feature"`)
- Step indicator: flag Leveling Choices as error when validation errors exist, matching current stage error styling
- Inline cues: counters turn warning state when > 0; unresolved choice cards stay expanded with instructional text
- Calculator error codes extend `validation.errors`; Stage 2+ read the same object so the experience is consistent across steps

#### Scaling Considerations
- Anticipate additional talent/path categories at higher levels; provide search/filter UI within accordions
- Support grouping by source (general vs class talents, subclass tiers) and allow collapsing completed sections to reduce cognitive load
- Employ progressive disclosure for large option sets (e.g., load more, lazy search) to keep DOM/render manageable
- Ensure state shape (`talentSelections`, `multiclassSelections`) accepts multiple entries per level to accommodate future rule changes

#### Validation & Testing Notes
- Unit tests exist for `characterContext` reducer; new tests should verify stage completion helpers under multi-level inputs
- Ensure calculated budgets (ancestry/background) align with UI assumptions to avoid false negatives in completion gating
- Future specs should reference this document when altering stage order, adding steps, or modifying completion rules
