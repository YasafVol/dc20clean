## üõ†Ô∏è TODO

### Critical Issues

- **Fix weapon selection crash**: The attack system currently crashes when selecting weapons on the character sheet page. The weapons.ts file has been deleted in favor of consolidating to inventoryItems.ts, but the attack system needs to be properly refactored to work with the inventory weapon structure. This requires updating the Attacks component to use the correct weapon properties and interfaces from inventoryItems.ts.

### Enhancements

- **Server-side mastery validation**: Add endpoint validation for mastery limits in character completion
- **Advanced class features**: Implement remaining class-specific features and progressions
- **Combat system**: Enhance attack calculations and combat mechanics
