# TODO Tracker

## ✅ COMPLETED ITEMS

### 0. Epic: Persist mastery/totals on character ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Status:** Fully implemented

**Deliverables:** All complete

- ✅ `denormalizeMastery.ts` service created
- ✅ Types defined in `dataContracts.ts`
- ✅ Integration in `characterCompletion.ts`
- ✅ PDF transformer uses denormalized fields
- ✅ For each skill and trade: governingAttributes, baseAttributeValues, masteryLevel, masteryLadder, finalValue
- ✅ Knowledge trades: ladder/finalValue with Intelligence attributes
- ✅ Practical trades A-D: { label, ladder, finalValue }
- ✅ Languages: `languageMastery` A-D = { name, limited, fluent }

**Evidence:**

- File: `src/lib/services/denormalizeMastery.ts` (205 lines)
- File: `src/lib/services/denormalizeMastery.spec.ts` (73 lines of tests)
- Integration: `characterCompletion.ts` lines 14, 67, 146-150
- PDF: `transformers.ts` consumes denormalized fields

**Acceptance:**

- ✅ Local export PDF matches UI for skills/trades/languages
- ✅ No regressions in Character Sheet rendering

---

### 3. PDF Export and Calculation Follow-ups ✅ **COMPLETE**

#### ✅ Rest Points Cap

- **Status:** Implemented
- Rest points equal final HP Max (verified in calculator)

#### ✅ Character Schema Extension

- **Status:** Schema extended in `dataContracts.ts` (lines 125-132)
- Fields added:
  - `finalPDHeavyThreshold`, `finalPDBrutalThreshold`
  - `finalADHeavyThreshold`, `finalADBrutalThreshold`
  - `bloodiedValue`, `wellBloodiedValue`
- **Note:** Thresholds are computed in `characterCompletion.ts` as needed

#### ✅ Attribute Save Values

- **Status:** Verified correct
- Formula: `attribute + combat mastery` (implemented in calculator)

## 🚧 REMAINING ITEMS

### 1. Flesh out Unit Tests for Core Logic ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Current gap:**

- Placeholder test files exist but contain only `expect(true).toBe(true)`
- Core utilities and hooks lack meaningful test coverage

**Files needing real tests:**

- `src/lib/utils/defenseNotes.spec.ts` - Currently 7 lines, needs ~50-100 lines
- `src/lib/services/spellAssignment.spec.ts` - Currently 7 lines, needs ~100-150 lines
- `src/lib/hooks/useEnhancedCharacterCalculation.spec.ts` - Currently 7 lines, needs ~80-120 lines

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Tests cover primary functions, edge cases, and invalid inputs
- `npm run test:unit` passes with meaningful coverage increase

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Write tests for `defenseNotes.ts` utilities (get, add, update, delete notes)
- [ ] Write tests for `spellAssignment.ts` service (class spell assignment logic)
- [ ] Write tests for `useEnhancedCharacterCalculation.ts` hook (requires mocking context)

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### 2. Low-Priority System Docs ⏸️ **DEFERRED**

**Tracked for future work:**

- Weapons & Items System — items schema, weapon damage derivation, UI interactions
- Currency System — model, validation, persistence, UI mapping
- Status & Exhaustion System — levels, effects, modal behavior
- Persistence — document localStorage + Convex data flow (Prisma removal complete)

**Note:** Current focus is on the newly added Spells, Martials, Calculation, Effect docs, and Character Sheet overview.

---

### 4. FE Ticket: Move UI calculations to character data ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Goal:** Remove all derived-calculation logic from UI components; consume precomputed values on `SavedCharacter` instead.

**Context (backend COMPLETE):**

- ✅ `SavedCharacter` persists denormalized background data
- ✅ PDF transformer already uses these fields
- ❌ Frontend UI still recomputes values from raw data

**Scope for FE migration:**

- [ ] Skills: Read `skillTotals` (and `skillMastery` for tooltips) instead of recomputing from `skillsData`
- [ ] Mastery ladders: Render from `masteryLadders.skills`, `masteryLadders.knowledgeTrades`, `masteryLadders.practicalTrades`
- [ ] Trade labels: Use `masteryLadders.practicalTrades.{A..D}.label`
- [ ] Languages: Use `languageMastery` A-D for Limited/Fluent display
- [ ] Defenses/bloodied: Display `finalPD/AD` thresholds and `bloodiedValue`/`wellBloodiedValue` directly
- [ ] Remove character sheet recalculation on load (trust stored data)

**Files to update:**

- `src/routes/character-sheet/hooks/CharacterSheetProvider.tsx` - Remove `calculateCharacterWithBreakdowns` on load
- All character sheet components that display skills/trades/languages
- Defense display components

**Acceptance:**

- [ ] No UI behavior changes; rendered values equal before/after migration
- [ ] `CharacterSheetProvider.tsx` does NOT recalculate on load
- [ ] PDF transformer contains zero math (only mapping from `SavedCharacter`)
- [ ] Unit tests cover consumption of new fields and graceful fallback

**Estimated effort:** 8-12 hours

---

### 6. Expand Multiclass Talent Selection ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Goal:** Allow selecting the same multiclass talent tier multiple times for different classes (e.g., Novice Multiclass twice to get Level 1 features from two different classes).

**Current limitation:**

- Multiclass talents are stored as single-select in `selectedTalents: Record<string, number>`
- Each tier (Novice, Adept, Expert, etc.) can only be taken once
- Cannot multiclass into multiple classes at the same tier level

**Proposed solution:**

- Change multiclass talent storage from count-based to instance-based
- New structure: `multiclassSelections: Array<{ tierId: string, classId: string, featureId: string }>`
- Each selection stores: which tier, which class, which feature
- Allow multiple instances of same tier pointing to different classes

**Example use case:**

- Level 4 character with 2 talent points
- Take "Novice Multiclass" → select Barbarian → get "Rage" (Level 1)
- Take "Novice Multiclass" again → select Wizard → get "Spell School Initiate" (Level 1)
- Result: Character has features from 2 different multiclass sources

**Implementation tasks:**

- [ ] Update `multiclassSelections` type in `characterContext.tsx` and `effectSystem.ts`
- [ ] Modify `LevelingChoices.tsx` multiclass UI to support multiple instances per tier
- [ ] Update calculator to process array of multiclass selections (not just single tier flags)
- [ ] Add validation: same tier + class combo cannot be selected twice
- [ ] Update persistence in `characterCompletion.ts` and `dataContracts.ts`
- [ ] Update talent budget counting to handle multiclass instances correctly
- [ ] Add unit tests for multiple multiclass selection scenarios
- [ ] Update LEVELING_SYSTEM.MD with multiclass instance rules

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] Can select same multiclass tier multiple times if pointing to different classes
- [ ] Each selection correctly applies effects from chosen feature
- [ ] Talent budget properly decrements for each multiclass selection
- [ ] Cannot select same tier + class combination twice
- [ ] Multiclass selections persist correctly on save/load
- [ ] UI clearly shows which classes have been multiclassed at which tiers

**Dependencies:**

- M3.17 (Complete Multiclass Talent System) ✅ Done
- Current multiclass system fully implemented

**Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours

## 📋 ADDITIONAL TASKS (from analysis)

### 5. Extract useAttributeCalculation Hook 🟡 **OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENT**

**Current state:**

- Attribute calculation logic is inline in `Attributes.tsx`
- Works correctly but not following original architectural plan

**Proposed:**

- Extract to `src/lib/hooks/useAttributeCalculation.ts`
- Improves testability and reusability
- Matches DATA_FLOW_REFACTOR architectural design

**Priority:** Low (current implementation works)
**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours

## 🎯 Recommended Priority Order

1. **HIGH:** FE Migration (Section 4) - Biggest architectural impact, removes duplicate logic
2. **MEDIUM:** Multiclass Expansion (Section 6) - Extends leveling system flexibility, builds on M3.17
3. **MEDIUM:** Unit Tests (Section 1) - Protects against regressions
4. **LOW:** Extract Hook (Section 5) - Nice to have, current code works

## 7. Convex Cloud Storage Integration ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Goal:** Provide optional Convex cloud storage for authenticated users (localStorage remains default).

**Status:** Implemented behind `VITE_USE_CONVEX=true` with `VITE_CONVEX_URL` configured.

**Implemented:**

- ✅ Convex schema (`convex/schema.ts`)
- ✅ Character CRUD mutations/queries (`convex/characters.ts`)
- ✅ Auth config (`convex/auth.config.ts`)
- ✅ Storage abstraction layer (`src/lib/storage/`)
- ✅ App provider wiring (`src/main.tsx`)
- ✅ Convex packages installed (`convex`, `@convex-dev/auth`)

**Operational notes:**

- Enable Convex by setting `VITE_USE_CONVEX=true` and `VITE_CONVEX_URL`.
- localStorage remains the default when Convex is disabled.

**See:** `docs/archive/CONVEX_MIGRATION.md` for the original migration checklist.
