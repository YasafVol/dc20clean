Alternatively, you can mark a creature by studying its tracks for at least 1 minute. While a creature is marked, you gain the following benefits: You have ADV on Awareness and Survival Checks made to find the target. The first Martial Attack against your target on your turn has ADV and ignores PDR. When you score a Heavy or Critical Hit against the target, you automatically grant a d8 Help Die to the next Attack made against the target before the start of your next turn. The target is marked as long as it’s on the same Plane of Existence as you, and vanishes early if you complete a Long Rest, fall Unconscious, or use this Feature again to mark another creature.",
