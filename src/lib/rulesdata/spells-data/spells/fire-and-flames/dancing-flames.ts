Success: You create up to 3 torch-sized Flames within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. Success (each 5): +1 Flame. Failure: 2 Flames. You can also combine 4 Flames into 1 glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium Size. Whichever form you choose, each Flame sheds Bright Light in a 2 Space radius. You can spend 1 AP to move the Flames up to 10 Spaces to a new Space within range. A Flame must be within 5 Spaces of another Flame created by this Spell and be within 20 Spaces from you, or it winks out of existence." }
