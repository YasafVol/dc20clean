## ‚úÖ Completed Work (from archived files)

### From DATA_FLOW_REFACTOR Plan:

#### Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization
- ‚úÖ **Task 1.1:** Created typed data contracts (`dataContracts.ts`)
- ‚úÖ **Task 1.3:** Eliminated state fragmentation (centralized storage utils)
- üü° **Task 1.2:** Partially complete - character sheet still recalculates (see remaining work)

#### Phase 2: Smart Character Creation  
- üü° **Task 2.1:** Attribute calculation exists inline (no dedicated hook, but works)
- üü° **Task 2.2:** Basic validation exists (not full spec, but functional)

#### Phase 3: Data Contract Cleanup
- ‚úÖ **Task 3.1:** Eliminated all legacy JSON fields (typed data throughout)
- ‚úÖ **Task 3.2:** Character completion uses typed contracts

### From TODO.md (Section 0):

#### Mastery Denormalization Epic
- ‚úÖ `denormalizeMastery.ts` service created (205 lines)
- ‚úÖ Types defined in `dataContracts.ts`
- ‚úÖ Integration in `characterCompletion.ts`
- ‚úÖ PDF transformer consumes denormalized fields
- ‚úÖ Skills, trades, languages all denormalized with masteryLadders
- ‚úÖ Unit tests written (73 lines in `denormalizeMastery.spec.ts`)

### From TODO.md (Section 3):

#### PDF Export & Calculation Follow-ups
- ‚úÖ Rest Points cap equals final HP Max
- ‚úÖ Character schema extended with heavy/brutal thresholds
- ‚úÖ Attribute save values use correct formula (attribute + combat mastery)

## üöß Remaining Work

### High Priority

#### 1. Frontend UI Migration (TODO Section 4)
**Status:** Not started  
**Backend:** Complete (all denormalized data available)  
**Effort:** 8-12 hours

**What needs to be done:**
- Remove recalculation in `CharacterSheetProvider.tsx`
- Update character sheet components to read from:
  - `skillTotals` instead of computing from `skillsData`
  - `masteryLadders` for proficiency display
  - `languageMastery` A-D for language display
  - Precomputed thresholds for defenses/bloodied

**Why it matters:**
- Performance: No recalculation on every sheet load
- Consistency: UI matches PDF export exactly
- Architecture: Single source of truth (stored calculations)

**Files to update:**
- `src/routes/character-sheet/hooks/CharacterSheetProvider.tsx` (remove recalc)
- Character sheet skill/trade/language display components

---

#### 2. Write Real Unit Tests (TODO Section 1)
**Status:** Placeholder tests only  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**What needs to be done:**
Replace `expect(true).toBe(true)` with real tests in:

1. **`defenseNotes.spec.ts`** (currently 7 lines ‚Üí needs 50-100 lines)
   - Test get/add/update/delete defense notes
   - Test field-specific note filtering
   - Test timestamp handling

2. **`spellAssignment.spec.ts`** (currently 7 lines ‚Üí needs 100-150 lines)
   - Test spell assignment by class
   - Test spell school filtering
   - Test feature choice integration

3. **`useEnhancedCharacterCalculation.spec.ts`** (currently 7 lines ‚Üí needs 80-120 lines)
   - Test calculation hook with mocked context
   - Test cache behavior
   - Test error handling

**Why it matters:**
- Zero regression protection currently
- Core utilities need test coverage
- Required for safe refactoring

---

### Low Priority (Optional Improvements)

#### 3. Extract useAttributeCalculation Hook (New)
**Status:** Inline logic works, no dedicated hook exists  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Current state:**
- `Attributes.tsx` line 155 has comment: "Simple replacement for useAttributeCalculation using context values"
- Logic is inline in component, not in a reusable hook

**If extracted:**
- Better testability
- More reusable
- Matches original architectural design from DATA_FLOW_REFACTOR plan

**Note:** This is optional - current implementation works fine.

## üìä Overall Completion Status

| Category | Complete | In Progress | Not Started | Total |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Data Contracts | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| Storage System | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| Mastery Denormalization | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4 |
| PDF Follow-ups | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 |
| UI Migration | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| Unit Tests | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 |
| Optional Improvements | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 |
| **TOTAL** | **11** | **2** | **5** | **18** |

**Completion: 61% (11/18 tasks complete)**

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. **Frontend UI Migration** - Biggest impact, removes duplicate logic
   - Start with: Remove recalculation in `CharacterSheetProvider.tsx`
   - Then: Migrate skill/trade displays one component at a time

### Near Term (Next Sprint)  
2. **Unit Tests** - Critical for quality
   - Start with: `defenseNotes.spec.ts` (simplest)
   - Then: `spellAssignment.spec.ts`
   - Finally: `useEnhancedCharacterCalculation.spec.ts` (requires mocking)

### Future (When Time Permits)
3. **Extract Hook** - Nice to have, not blocking

## üîç What Was Learned

### From DATA_FLOW_REFACTOR Analysis:

**Successes:**
- Typed data contracts throughout - no more JSON.parse in components
- Centralized storage utilities - single place for JSON handling
- Mastery denormalization - complete backend implementation

**Partial Completions:**
- Character sheet still recalculates (should trust stored data)
- Inline attribute logic (works but not in dedicated hook)
- Basic validation UI (not full sophisticated preview from spec)

**Architecture Wins:**
- Single source of truth for character data
- No duplicate fields in storage
- Clean separation: calculate once, store, display

### From TODO.md Analysis:

**Major Achievement:**
- Epic 0 (Mastery Denormalization) fully complete
- PDF Export follow-ups resolved
- Backend ready for frontend migration

**Gaps Identified:**
- Test files are placeholders (0% real coverage)
- Frontend hasn't migrated to use denormalized data
- Character sheet recalculates unnecessarily

---

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Backend is Solid** - All data structures and calculations in place
2. **Frontend Needs Catch-Up** - UI still doing calculations that backend already did
3. **Test Gap** - Placeholder tests provide false sense of security
4. **Performance Opportunity** - Removing recalculation will speed up sheet loads

**The remaining work is primarily about:**
- Using what we've built (frontend migration)
- Protecting what we've built (real unit tests)
- Optimizing what we've built (remove recalculation)

- [ ] Remove character sheet recalculation
- [ ] Migrate UI to use `skillTotals`, `masteryLadders`
- [ ] Write real tests for 3 placeholder test files

### Should Do
- [ ] Address orphaned traits (separate issue)
- [ ] Regenerate test coverage report after test improvements

### Could Do
- [ ] Extract `useAttributeCalculation` hook
- [ ] Add more sophisticated trait selection preview UI
