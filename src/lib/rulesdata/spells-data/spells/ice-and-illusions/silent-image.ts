			description:
				'You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon in a 3 Space cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual and isnâ€™t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects. You can spend 1 AP to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural. Discerning the Illusion: Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion. Alternatively, a creature can spend 1 AP to examine the image to attempt to determine if the illusion is real. The creature makes an Investigation Check against your Save DC. Success: The creature discerns the illusion for what it is, revealing it to be false and making the illusion transparent to the creature.'
