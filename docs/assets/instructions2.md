Of course. After a thorough comparison of the script-generated `DC20_corrected.md` file against the original PDF's structure, I have identified numerous hierarchical and formatting errors. The script appears to have defaulted to `##` for most subheadings and missed many of the deeper levels of nesting.

Below is a `diff` file that outlines the necessary changes. This format shows lines that should be removed (`-`) and lines that should be added (`+`). I have also included comments (`#`) to explain the reasoning behind major changes.

You can use this diff as a precise guide to manually correct the file or as a specification for a more advanced script.

### Summary of Major Errors to Correct:

1.  **Incorrect Header Levels:** The script consistently failed to apply the correct depth. Chapter titles should be `H1`, main sections `H2`, primary subsections `H3`, and specific features/rules `H4` or `H5`.
2.  **Missing Hierarchy:** Many bolded items in the PDF that represent a new sub-topic (like `Rage` or `Fire Bolt`) were left as plain text instead of being converted to headers.
3.  **False Headers:** The script created headers out of things that were just labels in the PDF, such as `Attack Check Formula`. These should be removed and left as bolded text if necessary.
4.  **List vs. Detail Confusion:** In the Skills section, the script conflated the initial `Skill List` with the detailed descriptions that followed, breaking the structure.
5.  **OCR Artifacts:** The script did not remove the image reference on the cover page.

By applying the changes in this diff, the markdown file will accurately reflect the intended structure of the original PDF, making it significantly more organized and readable.
