# DC20Clean – Leveling System (WIP)

> **Purpose**  
> This document is the single authoritative reference (“bible”) for the character leveling system. It outlines the data flow, calculation logic, and UI interactions required to create a character at any level from 1 to 5.
>
> **Status:** 🚧 **Work in Progress** - This specification outlines the planned implementation. It will be updated as milestones are completed.

## 1. High-Level Pipeline

The leveling system integrates directly into the character creation flow. It is initiated by a user selecting a target level at the start of the process. The core logic is handled by the `enhancedCharacterCalculator`, which aggregates all stats and choices granted up to that level.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Input"
        A["User selects Class and Level (1-5)"]
    end

    subgraph "Engine"
        B{"enhancedCharacterCalculator"}
    end

    subgraph "Data Sources"
        C1["/rulesdata/classes-data/progression/*.ts"]
        C2["/rulesdata/talents/*.ts"]
        C3["/rulesdata/paths/*.ts"]
    end

    subgraph "Output"
        D["Aggregated Budgets & Choices\n(Total Points, Talents, Paths, etc.)"]
    end
    
    subgraph "UI Flow"
        E["Character Creation Stages"]
    end

    A --> B
    C1 & C2 & C3 --> B
    B -- "Calculates totals for target level" --> D
    D -- "Populates budgets for each stage" --> E

## 3. Core Mechanics & Logic

### 3.1. Level Selection
-   A dropdown will be added to **Stage 1: Class & Features** allowing the user to select a starting level from 1 to 5.
-   This selection is stored in the `characterContext` and is a primary input for the `enhancedCharacterCalculator`.

### 3.2. Aggregation Engine
-   The calculator will read the character's `classId` and `level`.
-   It will then iterate through the corresponding `...progression.ts` file from `level: 1` to the target `level`.
-   In each iteration, it will sum the values from the `gained...` properties (e.g., `gainedHealth`, `gainedAttributePoints`) and the `gains` object (e.g., `talents`, `pathPoints`).
-   The final output is a single set of budgets that represents the character's total resources for their level.

### 3.3. Conditional "Leveling Choices" Stage
-   This new stage will appear at **Step 2** if the character's target level is greater than 1.
-   It will contain two sections:
    1.  **Talent Selection:** Allows the user to choose from General, Class, and Multiclass talents until their `talentsToChoose` budget is 0.
    2.  **Path Point Allocation:** Allows the user to spend their `pathPointsToSpend` budget on the Martial and Spellcaster paths.
-   The "Next" button for this stage will be disabled until all points are spent.

### 3.4. Path Point Bonuses (M3.9 - ✅ IMPLEMENTED)

Path points grant immediate bonuses to character resources based on allocation:

**Martial Path Progression:**
| Path Level | Stamina Points | Maneuvers Learned | Techniques Learned |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1          | +1             | +1                | +1                |
| 2          | —              | +1                | —                 |
| 3          | +1             | +1                | +1                |
| 4          | —              | +1                | —                 |

**Spellcaster Path Progression:**
| Path Level | Mana Points | Cantrips Learned | Spells Learned |
|------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1          | +2          | +1               | +1             |
| 2          | +2          | +1               | —              |
| 3          | +2          | +1               | +1             |
| 4          | +2          | —                | +1             |

**Implementation:**
- Path bonuses are calculated by `aggregatePathBenefits()` in `enhancedCharacterCalculator.ts`
- Bonuses are added to base progression gains in `aggregateProgressionGains()`
- Data source: `src/lib/rulesdata/paths/paths.data.ts`
- Type: `pathPointAllocations?: { martial?: number; spellcasting?: number }` in `EnhancedCharacterBuildData`

**Example (Level 5 Barbarian with 2 martial path points):**
- SP: 1 (L1) + 1 (L3) + 1 (path L1) = **3**
- Maneuvers: 4 (L1) + 1 (L5) + 1 (path L1) + 1 (path L2) = **7**
- Techniques: 1 (L3) + 1 (L5) + 1 (path L1) = **3**

### 3.5. Dynamic Budgeting in Subsequent Stages
-   **Ancestry (Stage 3):** The "Ancestry Points Remaining" counter will be initialized with `5 + aggregated ancestryPoints`.
-   **Attributes (Stage 4):** The "Attribute Points Remaining" counter will be initialized with `12 + aggregated attributePoints`.
-   **Background (Stage 5):** The Skill, Trade, and Language point counters will be initialized with their base values plus any aggregated points from the progression tables.

---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

-   A user can select a starting level of 3 for a Barbarian.
-   The "Leveling Choices" stage appears, showing a budget of **1 Talent** and **1 Path Point** to spend (from the Level 2 progression).
-   The "Attributes" stage shows a budget of **13 Attribute Points** (12 base + 1 from Level 3 progression).
-   The final saved character sheet correctly reflects all stats and features for a Level 3 Barbarian.

## 10. Multiclass System

### 10.1. Overview

The multiclass talent system allows characters to gain features from other classes by spending **Talent Points**. This system is fully integrated into the leveling choices stage.

**Location:** `src/lib/rulesdata/progression/multiclass.ts`

**Detailed Documentation:** See `docs/systems/MULTICLASS_SYSTEM.MD`

### 10.2. Six Multiclass Tiers

| Tier | Level | Feature Level | Subclass? | Prerequisites |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| Novice | 2+ | 1st level | No | None |
| Adept | 4+ | 2nd level | No | None |
| Expert | 7+ | 5th or 3rd subclass | Yes | 1+ class features |
| Master | 10+ | 6th subclass only | Yes | 1+ subclass features |
| Grandmaster | 13+ | 8th level (capstone) | No | 2+ class features |
| Legendary | 17+ | 9th subclass (capstone) | Yes | 2+ subclass features |

### 10.3. Implementation Highlights

**UI:** 
- Card-based feature selection in `LevelingChoices.tsx`
- Dynamic tier availability based on level
- Prerequisite validation before showing tiers
- Path features automatically filtered out

**Effects:**
- Integrated into `aggregateAttributedEffects()` in calculator
- Multiclass feature effects modify character stats
- Properly attributed for breakdowns and tooltips

**Persistence:**
- Multiclass selections saved to `SavedCharacter`
- Preserved across save/load and level-up
- Fields: `selectedMulticlassOption`, `selectedMulticlassClass`, `selectedMulticlassFeature`

**Testing:**
- 31 unit tests in `multiclass.test.ts`
- All tests passing
- Coverage: data integrity, prerequisites, helper functions

### 10.4. Related Milestones

- **M3.17:** Complete multiclass system implementation
- **Status:** ✅ Done
- **Epic Reference:** `docs/plannedSpecs/LEVELING_EPIC.md` §5.18
