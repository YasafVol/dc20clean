# DC20Clean – Trades With Multiple Attributes (Spec, Prompt, Tracker)

> Purpose
>
> - Define rules, data contracts, UI, runtime logic, tests, and migration notes for expanding Trades to support multiple governing attributes.
> - Provide a ready-to-run implementation prompt for agents/humans.
> - Track work with a task checklist and status table.

---

## 1. Summary

- Trades may be governed by one or more attributes (1–4) instead of a single attribute.
- For a given Trade and proficiency level, compute one total per allowed attribute:
  - total = masteryBonus + attributeModifier
  - masteryBonus = proficiency × 2
  - attributeModifier ∈ {finalMight, finalAgility, finalCharisma, finalIntelligence}
- Character Sheet must display all applicable totals, sorted descending, compact format: e.g., Brewing +4(A)/+3(C)/+1(I).
- Character Creation should show the list of governing attributes for each Trade.
- Knowledge Trades are still identified by tools = "none" and remain Intelligence by default (unless a future spec changes them).

---

## 2. Data Contracts

### 2.1 ITradeData (rulesdata schema)

- Old
  - attributeAssociation: 'might' | 'agility' | 'charisma' | 'intelligence'
- New
  - attributeAssociations: Array<'might' | 'agility' | 'charisma' | 'intelligence'>
  - tools: string (unchanged; "none" denotes Knowledge Trades)

Notes
- All usages that display a Trade’s governing attribute(s) must be updated to join/format `attributeAssociations`.
- Knowledge Trades continue to use tools: 'none'.

### 2.2 UI TradeData (runtime)

- Extend the UI shape used by Character Sheet for Trades:
  - Keep `bonus?: number` (for knowledge compat), and add `bonuses?: Array<{ attribute: 'might' | 'agility' | 'charisma' | 'intelligence'; total: number }>`
  - UI renders `bonuses` when present; otherwise falls back to `bonus`.

---

## 3. Canonical Trade List Changes

Apply the following multi-attribute mappings to `src/lib/rulesdata/trades.ts` (keeping names as they exist in data):

- Alchemy – Tools: Alchemist's Supplies – Attributes: Intelligence, Agility
- Brewing – Tools: Brewer's Supplies – Attributes: Agility, Intelligence, Charisma
- Carpentry – Tools: Carpenter's Tools – Attributes: Agility, Might
- Cartography – Tools: Cartographer's Tools – Attributes: Intelligence, Agility
- Cooking – Tools: Cook's Utensils – Attributes: Agility, Intelligence, Charisma
- Disguise – Tools: Disguise Kit – Attributes: Agility, Charisma
- Gaming – Tools: Gaming Set – Attributes: Intelligence, Charisma
- Glassblowing – Tools: Glassblower's Tools – Attributes: Agility, Might (add new entry)
- Lockpicking – Tools: Lockpicking Tools – Attributes: Agility, Intelligence (add new entry)
- Music (Musician) – Tools: Musical Instrument – Attributes: Agility, Charisma
- Tinkering – Tools: Tinkerer's Tools – Attributes: Agility, Intelligence (add new entry)
- Vehicles (Land) – Tools: Vehicle – Attributes: Agility, Intelligence, Might
- Vehicles (Water) – Tools: Vehicle – Attributes: Agility, Intelligence, Might

Knowledge Trades
- Keep as tools: 'none', governed by Intelligence (unchanged in this spec).

---

## 4. Calculation Rules

- For each selected Trade with proficiency p (0–5):
  - masteryBonus = 2 × p
  - For each allowed attribute A in `attributeAssociations`, compute total(A) = masteryBonus + finalA
  - Character sheet renders all totals sorted descending by `total(A)`; tie-breaker: A > M > C > I (or any stable order you prefer)

Acceptance example
- Attributes: Might 3, Agility 2, Charisma 1, Intelligence -1; Brewing proficiency 1 (mastery +2)
- Allowed: A, I, C → Totals: A=4, C=3, I=1 → Display: Brewing +4(A)/+3(C)/+1(I)

---

## 5. UI/UX Changes

Character Sheet
- Trades list should display proficiency dots as before.
- Next to the dots, display the compact bonuses string when `bonuses` exists, else show single `bonus` (knowledge).
- Example format: "+4(A)/+3(C)/+1(I)".

Character Creation – Trades Tab
- Where we previously showed a single attribute, show a joined list of attributes (e.g., "Agility/Intelligence/Charisma").
- Tool requirement line unchanged.

Trait Choice UI (if describing trades)
- Replace single attribute mention with joined attribute list.

---

## 6. Code Touchpoints

- Data & Types
  - `src/lib/rulesdata/schemas/types.ts` → `ITradeData.attributeAssociations: string[]`
  - `src/lib/rulesdata/trades.ts` → convert data to plural field + new entries + Vehicles updates
  - `src/types/character.ts` → extend `TradeData` with optional `bonuses` array

- Calculations/Provider Hooks
  - `src/routes/character-sheet/hooks/CharacterSheetProvider.tsx` → in `useCharacterTrades()` compute per-attribute totals and return `bonuses`
  - Knowledge hook remains unchanged

- UI Components
  - Character Sheet Trades: `KnowledgeTrades.tsx` (and any desktop/mobile/clean variants) → render multi-bonus string
  - Character Creation: `TradesTab.tsx` → show joined `attributeAssociations`
  - Trait choice descriptors: `TraitChoiceSelector.tsx` → show joined `attributeAssociations`

- Tests
  - `src/lib/rulesdata/trades.spec.ts` → assert knowledge tools 'none'; assert multi-attribute sets exist for updated trades
  - Add a unit test for formatting a Brewing example (optional helper)

- Docs
  - Link this file from `docs/systems/BACKGROUND_SYSTEM.MD`

---

## 7. Migration & Compatibility

Saved Characters
- No change to storage schema for `tradesData` (still `Record<string, number>` proficiency).
- Multi-attribute is purely a data and presentation change; calculations read final attributes from the character and display multiple totals.

Vehicles Consolidation (optional future)
- If combining `Vehicles (Land)` and `Vehicles (Water)` into one entry, a save migration must remap IDs. Out of scope for this spec.

---

## 8. Second-Order Effects / Risks

- Any place that uses `trade.attributeAssociation` must be updated to the plural `attributeAssociations` to avoid regressions.
- Sorting rule for the display string must be stable to avoid flicker when re-rendering.
- Tests and snapshots referencing single attribute strings need updates.
- Ensure newly added trades (Glassblowing, Lockpicking, Tinkering) integrate into the points system and selection limits.

---

## 9. Agent/Human Implementation Prompt

You are updating DC20Clean to support Trades with multiple governing attributes.

Do the following:
1) Data and Types
- In `src/lib/rulesdata/schemas/types.ts`, replace `attributeAssociation` with `attributeAssociations: Array<'might'|'agility'|'charisma'|'intelligence'>`.
- In `src/lib/rulesdata/trades.ts`, convert all entries to `attributeAssociations` and apply the mapping defined in this spec. Add Glassblowing, Lockpicking, Tinkering. Update Vehicles (Land/Water) tools to "Vehicle" and allow A/I/M.
- In `src/types/character.ts`, extend `TradeData` to include optional `bonuses` array while retaining `bonus` for knowledge.

2) Calculations
- In `useCharacterTrades()` (CharacterSheetProvider), compute masteryBonus = proficiency×2; for each attribute in `attributeAssociations`, compute total = masteryBonus + finalAttr. Return `bonuses` sorted desc by total. Maintain knowledge hook as-is.

3) UI
- Character Sheet Trades component(s): when `bonuses` exists, render a compact string like "+4(A)/+3(C)/+1(I)" next to the dots. If only `bonus` exists (knowledge), render it as today.
- Character Creation `TradesTab.tsx`: replace single attribute text with a joined attribute list.
- `TraitChoiceSelector.tsx`: update descriptors to show joined attributes.

4) Tests & Docs
- Update `src/lib/rulesdata/trades.spec.ts` to assert multi-attribute sets and tools for knowledge.
- Optionally add a small unit test for formatting the Brewing example.
- Link this file from `docs/systems/BACKGROUND_SYSTEM.MD` under the Trades section.

Constraints
- Do not change how Knowledge Trades are identified (tools: 'none').
- Keep saved character schema unchanged.
- Preserve formatting and coding style.

Acceptance Criteria
- Brewing example renders as: Brewing +4(A)/+3(C)/+1(I) for attributes (M=3, A=2, C=1, I=-1) with proficiency 1.
- Creation UI shows plural attribute lists for affected trades.
- All tests pass.
