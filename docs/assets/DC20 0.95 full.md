## Attributes & Prime Modifier

## Attributes

There are 4 Attributes in DC20 that represent your Physical (Might & Agility) and Mental (Intelligence & Charisma) abilities. Each Attribute has a value that ranges from -2 to +7 (for most creatures) which measures your aptitude with that Attribute.

- **Might** = your Strength of Body.
- **Agility** = your Balance, Nimbleness, and Dexterity.
- **Charisma** = your Charm, Presence, Persuasiveness, and Force of Will.
- **Intelligence** = your Reasoning, Understanding, and Wisdom.

Example: If you have an Agility of 3, then you would add +3 to any d20 roll that uses Agility.

## Might

This represents your physical strength, health, and endurance. It's commonly associated with the following:

- Your Might is added to your Area Defense.
- Your Might is added to your maximum Health Points.
- Checks made to Initiate or Escape Grapples use Athletics (Might) Checks.
- Might contributes to lifting, pushing, dragging, throwing, and encumbrance.
- Might Saves are made to resist effects that push you away, knock you down, or crush you.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay a PC that is the 'go to' for being the strong one and overpowering your enemies, then Might is for YOU!

## Agility

This represents your avoidance, dexterity, and finesse. It's commonly associated with the following:

- Your Agility is added to your Precision Defense.
- Agility contributes to your Initiative Check.
- Checks made to Escape Grapples use Acrobatics (Agility) Checks.
- Agility contributes to jumping and reducing damage taken from falling.
- Agility Saves are made to resist effects that reduce your Speed, cause you to lose your balance, or can be avoided by dodging out of the way.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay a PC that is nimble, light on their feet, and good with their hands, then Agility is for YOU!

## Charisma

This represents your charm, presence, and force of will. Anything related to interacting socially with other creatures (your appearance, mannerisms, and the words you say) is Charisma. It's commonly associated with the following:

- Your Charisma is added to your Area Defense.
- Charisma can contribute to Language Checks made to understand languages you have limited fluency with.
- You gain a number of Grit Points equal to your Charisma + 2. See 'Grit Points: 2 + Charisma' on page 93.
- Social Skill Checks use Charisma, such as the Skills to Influence other creatures or to gain Insights into their actions or behaviors.
- Charisma Saves are made to resist effects that attempt to alter your emotions or dominate your will.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay as the 'face of the party' and have good people skills, then Charisma is for YOU!

## Intelligence

This represents your reasoning, understanding, and wisdom. Anything that is related to a person's intellectual capacity or overall knowledge falls under Intelligence. It's commonly associated with the following:

- Your Intelligence is added to your Precision Defense.
- Intelligence can contribute to Language Checks made to understand languages you have limited fluency with.
- You gain a number of bonus Skill Points to spend on more Skills.
- Knowledge Trade Checks use Intelligence, such as the knowledge of Engineering, Nature, Religion, Occultism, History, or Magic (Arcana).
- Intelligence Saves are made to resist effects that attempt to read your thoughts, alter your memories, confuse you, or use illusions to deceive your senses.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay a PC that is the smartest person in the room and just knows things, then Intelligence is for YOU!

## Starting Attributes

You get your PC Attributes from one of the following methods and then assign the values to each of the 4 Attributes.

## Standard Method

You start with an array of 3, 1, 0, -2 and assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain 2 additional Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

## Point Buy

You start with a -2 in all of your Attributes. You then gain 12 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**DC Tip:** Your Prime Modifier (see later in this chapter) comes from your highest Attribute, so it's a good idea to make sure that you get a 3 in at least one of your Attributes.

## Roll Method

You determine your starting values by rolling 1d6-3 four times, and then assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain +2 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**Prime Modifier Insurance:** If the value of your highest Attribute is less than 3 (even after adding the +2 Attribute Points), you can reduce a different Attribute value by 1 or more to increase your highest Attribute by the same amount. You can't reduce an Attribute value below -2 or increase an Attribute above your Attribute Limit (3).

**DC Tip:** This method of determining your starting Attributes is the most risky. It offers the potential for the highest starting Attributes, but also the lowest. If you add all your Attributes together, their sum should be 4 (on average), after the +2 bonus points are added.

## Attribute Limit

You can increase your Attributes as you gain levels, however you can't increase an Attribute past the Attribute Limit. The Attribute Limit increases at certain levels as shown in the table below. You can increase an Attribute at the same level that your Attribute Limit increases.

| PC Level | Attribute Limit |
|---|---|
| 1 | +3 |
| 5 | +4 |
| 10 | +5 |
| 15 | +6 |
| 20 | +7 |

## Gaining Attribute Points

As your Player Character (PC) levels up they will regularly gain more Attribute Points to increase their Attributes. PCs gain +1 Attribute Point at levels 3, 5, 8, and 10 (see 'Player Character Progression Table' on page 95 for more information).

**DC Tip:** You get more of these points beyond level 10 as well!

## Prime Modifier

Your Prime Modifier represents your overall experience and prowess as an adventurer. You use your Prime Modifier as the primary bonus you add to Checks involving attacking, casting a Spell, or overall awareness of dangers around you. Your Prime Modifier is commonly associated with the following:

- Attack Checks (made to Attack with a Weapon or Unarmed Strike).
- Spell Checks (made to cast a Spell or use a supernatural ability).
- Save DCs (the difficulty of resisting the effects you impose on other creatures).
- Awareness Checks (your ability to perceive and detect things around you).

**DC Tip:** The Barbarian in the group having a high Charisma instead of Might doesn't make him worse at swinging a sword.

## Prime Modifier Value

Your value of your Prime Modifier is always equal to the value of your highest Attribute. If your highest Attribute changes, your Prime Modifier derives its value from the value of your new highest Attribute. Your Prime Modifier is not an Attribute, nor considered the Attribute that it derives its value from.

Example: If Might is your highest Attribute, then your Prime Modifier derives its value from the value of your Might. If your Might is 3, then your Prime Modifier is 3. If an effect grants you ADV on Might Checks, it does not also grant you ADV on Checks that use your Prime Modifier (such as Attack Checks and Spell Checks) unless the effect otherwise says so.

## Variant Rules

## Prime Modifier Equals Attribute Limit

Instead of Prime Modifier being determined by a PC's highest Attribute, it's instead equal to their Attribute Limit. This means it will always be 'maxed out', no matter where you put your Attributes Points. This rule is designed for Players who want to create a PC that's more well-rounded and doesn't have one or two main Attributes they lean heavily on. This rule allows for Players to have more freedom in character creation, because their Prime Modifier will always start at 3 and progress with their level.

**DC Tip:** Be aware that if everyone in the group builds a balanced PC, then no one in the group will be the go to for certain activities or skills. This can ruin the nuanced group dynamics that TTRPG parties are often designed around, where every PC feels like they have a strong purpose that's supported by mechanical advantages and not just narrative choices. If you like to have groups in which each PC gets their moments in the spotlight, then this might not be a rule for you.

## Prime Modifier Sidebar

The Prime Modifier allows you to create the kind of character you truly want to play without negatively impacting their combat prowess. Since your Prime Modifier will be used to swing weapons and cast Spells, this allows you to choose which Attribute you want to be the highest without feeling forced into picking a specific one. An Intelligent or Charismatic Barbarian may not have as much health or be able to grapple or lift as much as a Might Barbarian, but your ability to wield a weapon is the same.

You can choose whether you roleplay the source of which Attribute your Prime Modifier comes from in Combat or not. It's up to you. You could describe your intelligent Barbarian as being a tactical mastermind on the battlefield, or your charismatic Barbarian as a fiery confident leader, or you can be a mindless rage monster in Combat if you want to just smash things. This is an opportunity to create the PC you want.

## Skills

Skills are representative of a creature's ability to perform certain activities. If two creatures are wrestling each other, they can use the Athletics Skill to compete against each other. Every Skill is tied to an Attribute (Might, Agility, Intelligence, or Charisma). Each Skill represents an aspect of an Attribute, such as Athletics being an aspect of a creature's Might Attribute, or Acrobatics with its Agility Attribute. The Awareness Skill uses your Prime Attribute, which is your highest Attribute.

**DC Tip:** There are countless ways to use these Skills, especially when you use the 'Variable Attribute Rule' (see Checks and Saves section). You can really get outside the box by combining Skill with different Attributes.

**DC Tip:** The Knowledge Trades don't have Tools listed because they're Trades that only involve the recalling or teaching of information.

## Trade Attributes

Every Trade is tied to an Attribute. The Attribute represents what might be needed to perform this Trade, such as the use of one's own strength (Might), intricate hand movements (Agility), knowledge and understanding (Intelligence), or interactions with others (Charisma).

**Variant Attributes:** There are ways that you might use other Attributes in alternative combinations for Trades in unique circumstances. A theater performer might use Charisma to capture the hearts of their audience with an emotional performance, Agility to perform a fast-paced dance, Might to throw a theater partner into the air, or Intelligence to remember the lines of a detailed monologue.

## Mastery & Training

Mastery represents your level of competency within different categories. When you have Mastery with something (such as a Skill, Trade, or Language), you gain certain bonuses to actions that use that Mastery. Conversely, when you lack Mastery with something you may suffer certain penalties (such as adding no bonuses to those rolls).

## Mastery Types

There are several types of Mastery:

- **Skill Mastery:** Your Mastery with certain skill sets, such as Awareness, Stealth, and Investigation. These are Skills used to interact with the environment and the creatures that inhabit it.
- **Trade Mastery:** Your Mastery with certain professions, such as Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Artistry. These are Trades used to craft goods and provide services.
- **Language Mastery:** Your fluency with certain Languages. This Mastery is used to govern how well you can read, write, speak, and understand different Languages.
- **Combat Mastery:** Your prowess on the battlefield, such as Attacks, Defenses, and Saves. This Mastery represents your general ability to fight and survive against other creatures.

## Gaining Mastery

You can gain Mastery from your Class, Class Features, Subclass Features, Ancestry Traits, or Talents. You'll have opportunities at character creation and when your PC levels up to select a variety of options to gain any of the above Mastery Types.

## Skill Mastery

Skill Mastery represents your proficiency with a Skill. There are several Skill Mastery Levels, ranging from Novice to Grandmaster. Each increasing Level of Skill Mastery grants greater bonuses to the Skill Checks in which you have Mastery (see Skills for more information on the different Skills).

## Skill Mastery Levels & Limits

There are 5 Skill Mastery Levels. Each Skill Mastery Level grants you a +2 bonus on the respective Skill Checks. Your Skill Mastery Limit starts at Novice and increases based on your Character Level as shown in the table below.

| Character Level | Mastery Limit | Mastery Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Novice | +2 |
| 5 | Adept | +4 |
| 10 | Expert | +6 |
| 15 | Master | +8 |
| 20 | Grandmaster | +10 |

**Example 1:** If you have 2 Skill Mastery Levels in the Athletics Skill (Adept), you add a +4 bonus (+2 per Level) to any Athletics Check you make. See Checks & Saves for more information on making Skill Checks.

**Example 2:** If a PC has a Skill Mastery Limit of Adept, they can allocate up to 2 Skill Points into a single Skill, such as the Awareness Skill. If that PC has additional Skill Points to allocate, they can't allocate them into the Awareness Skill until their Skill Mastery Limit increases to Expert or higher.

## Gaining Skill Mastery

You can increase your Skill Mastery Level from Skill Points or from certain Traits, Features, or Talents.

## Skill Mastery Level Increases

You can gain Skill Mastery directly through Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents.

- **Class Skills:** Some Classes (such as Hunter) grant Skill Mastery based on chosen Feature options.
- **Ancestry Skills:** Some Ancestries (such as Humans) grant Skill Mastery.

## Skill Points

You can spend Skill Points to increase your Skill Mastery Level in a given Skill, up to your Skill Mastery Limit. You gain Skill Points from your Background, Class, Intelligence, and possibly from Talents you choose.

- **Background Skills:** Your Background grants you 5 Skill Points.
- **Class Skills:** All Classes grant additional Skill Points based on your Level.
- **Talent Skills:** Some Talents (such as Skill Increase) grant additional Skill Points.
- **Intelligence Skills:** You gain a number of Skill Points equal to your Intelligence. If your Intelligence is negative, then your total Skill Points is reduced by the same amount. If your Intelligence changes, your total Skill Points change by an equal amount.

## Increasing your Skill Mastery Limit

Some Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents can increase your Skill Mastery Limit. A Skill can only benefit from 1 bonus to its Skill Mastery Limit at a time. When your Skill Mastery Limit increases at the normal level, it continues to be benefit from the bonus to its Skill Mastery Limit.

**Example 1:** The Skill Mastery Limit of a Level 1 PC is Novice. If that PC is a Human, they can take the Human Ancestry Trait: Skill Expertise, which increases the Skill Mastery Limit of 1 Skill of their choice. If they choose the Awareness Skill, the Skill Mastery Limit of the Awareness raises from Novice to Adept. If that PC gains another Trait, Feature, or Talent that increases their Skill Mastery Limit, then Awareness won't benefit from it because it's Skill Mastery Limit has already been increased beyond its normal level.

**Example 2:** A Level 1 PC has a Skill Mastery Limit of Novice. If it gains a bonus to its Skill Mastery Limit (such as through the Roguish Finesse Feature), it's Skill Mastery Limit increases to Adept. When its Skill Mastery Increases normally at Level 5, its Skill Mastery Limit increases to Expert.

## Skill Points to Increase Skill Mastery Limit

You can increase your Skill Mastery using Skill Points. Choose a Skill. You can spend 1 Skill Point to increase its Skill Mastery Limit by 1. You must still spend another Skill Point to increase its Skill Mastery Level to meet the new Limit.

**Example:** A Bard spends 1 Skill Point to get Novice Skill Mastery in the Influence Skill. Then they spend 1 Skill Point to increase their Skill Mastery Limit in Influence from Novice to Adept and an additional Skill Point to increase their Skill Mastery Level in Influence also to Adept. In total, they spent 3 Skill Points to raise their Skill Mastery Level with the Influence Skill from having no Skill Mastery to now having Adept Skill Mastery.

## Lacking Skill Mastery

When you make a Skill Check using a Skill in which you lack Mastery, you don't gain a Skill Mastery bonus on the Check.

**DC Tip:** Certain abilities might require a certain level of Mastery to perform, or other passive abilities might be granted to those of different Mastery Levels. There are a lot of possibilities here.

## Trade Mastery

Trade Mastery represents your proficiency with a Trade. There are several Trade Mastery Levels, ranging from Novice to Grandmaster. Each increasing Level of Trade Mastery grants greater bonuses to the Trade Checks in which you have Mastery (see Trades for more information on the different Trades).

## Trade Mastery Levels & Limits

There are 5 Trade Mastery Levels. Each Trade Mastery Level grants you a +2 bonus on the respective Skill Checks. Your Trade Mastery Limit starts at Novice and increases based on your Character Level as shown in the table below.

| Character Level | Mastery Limit | Mastery Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Novice | +2 |
| 5 | Adept | +4 |
| 10 | Expert | +6 |
| 15 | Master | +8 |
| 20 | Grandmaster | +10 |

**Example 1:** If you have 3 Trade Mastery Levels in the Alchemy Trade (Expert), you add a +6 bonus (+2 per Level) to any Alchemy Check you make. See 'Checks & Saves' on page 23 for more information on making Trade Checks.

**Example 2:** If a PC has a Trade Mastery Limit of Adept, they can allocate up to 2 Trade Points into a single Trade, such as the Cartography Trade. If that PC has additional Trade Points to allocate, they can't allocate them into the Cartography Trade until their Trade Mastery Limit increases to Expert or higher.

## Gaining Trade Mastery

You can increase your Trade Mastery Level from Trade Points or from certain Traits, Features, or Talents.

## Trade Mastery Level

## Increases

You can gain Trade Mastery directly through Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents.

- **Ancestry Trades:** Some Ancestries (such as Humans) grant Mastery with specific Trades.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Trade Points

You can spend Trade Points to increase your Trade Mastery Level in a given Trade, up to your Trade Mastery Limit. You gain Trade Points from your Background, and possibly from your Ancestry, Class, and Talents you choose.

- **Background Trades:** Your Background grants you 3 Trade Points.
- **Class Trades:** All Classes grant additional Trade Points based on your Level.
- **Talent Trades:** Some Talents (such as Trade Increase) grant additional Trade Points.

## Converting Skill Points to Trade Points

You can convert 1 Skill Point into 2 Trade Points (but not the other way around).

## Increasing your Trade Mastery Limit

Some Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents can increase your Trade Mastery Limit. A Trade can only benefit from 1 bonus to its Trade Mastery Limit at a time. When your Trade Mastery Limit increases at the normal level, it continues to be benefit from the bonus to its Trade Mastery Limit.

**Example 1:** The Trade Mastery Limit of a Level 1 PC is Novice. If that PC is a Human, they can take the Human Ancestry Trait: Trade Expertise, which increases the Trade Mastery Limit of 1 Trade of their choice. If they choose the Gaming Trade, the Trade Mastery Limit of the Gaming Trade raises from Novice to Adept. If that PC gains another Trait, Feature, or Talent that increases their Trade Mastery Limit, then Gaming won't benefit from it because it's Trade Mastery Limit has already been increased beyond its normal level.

**Example 2:** A Level 1 PC has a Trade Mastery Limit of Novice. If it gains a bonus to its Trade Mastery Limit (such as through the Trade Expertise Ancestry Trait), it's Trade Mastery Limit increases to Adept. When its Trade Mastery Increases normally at Level 5, its Trade Mastery Limit increases to Expert.

## Trade Points to Increase Trade Mastery Limit

You can increase your Trade Mastery using Trade Points. Choose a Trade you do not have Mastery in, you can spend 1 Trade Point to increase its Trade Mastery Limit by 1. You must still spend another Trade Point to increase its Trade Mastery Level to meet the new Limit.

**Example:** A Champion spends 1 Trade Point to get Novice Trade Mastery in the Blacksmithing Trade. Then they spend 1 Trade Point to increase their Trade Mastery Limit in Blacksmithing to Adept and an additional Trade Point to increase their Trade Mastery Level in Blacksmithing also to Adept. In total, they spent 3 Trade Points to raise their Trade Mastery Level with the Blacksmithing Trade from having no Trade Mastery to Adept Trade Mastery.

## Lacking Trade Mastery

When you make a Trade Check using a Trade in which you lack Mastery, you don't gain a Trade Mastery bonus on the Check. Some Trade Checks might be harder to perform or not possible at all if you don't have the tools needed or if you're using some kind of improvised tools.

**DC Tip:** Certain abilities might require a certain level of Mastery to perform, or other passive abilities might be granted to those of different Mastery Levels. There are a lot of possibilities here.

## Language Mastery

Language Mastery represents your fluency with a Language. There are only 2 Language Mastery Levels: Limited and Fluent. See Languages for more information on the different Languages.

## Language Mastery Levels

You can spend Trade Points (see Trade Mastery above) to increase your Language Mastery Level in a given Language, up to the maximum Language Mastery Level of 2 (Fluent).

| Mastery Level | Language Fluency |
|---|---|
| 0-None | You don't know the language. |
| 1-Limited | You can read, write, and speak, but you must make a Language Check and succeed to do so. |
| 2-Fluent | You can read, write, and speak fluently. |

**Example:** If you have 1 level of Language Mastery (Limited) in the Goblin Language, you can make a Language Check to attempt to read, write, speak, or understand the Goblin Language. Alternatively, 2 levels of Language Mastery (Fluent) would allow you to do so without needing to make a Check. See 'Checks & Saves' on page 23 for more information on making Language Checks.

<!-- image -->

**DC Tip:** In this system, there's more of a progression to learning a language and there are more subtle interactions that happen both from a roleplay standpoint and a mechanics standpoint.

## Language Mastery Limit

There's no Mastery Limit for Languages. You can use Language Points to increase your Language Mastery in as many Languages as there are available to you.

## Gaining Language Mastery

You are Fluent in Common. You can gain additional Language Mastery using Language Points.

## Language Points

You gain Language Points from your Background, and possibly from Talents you choose.

- **Background Languages:** Your Background grants you Common Fluency and 2 Language Points.
- **Talent Languages:** Some Talents (such as Trade Increase) grant additional Trade Points, which you can convert to Language Points (see below).

## Converting Trade Points to Language Points

You can convert 1 Trade Point into 2 Language Points (but not the other way around).

**DC Tip:** Because 1 Skill Point can be converted into 2 Trades Points, this means that 1 Skill Point can effectively be turned into 4 Language Points.

## Lacking Language Mastery

If you don't have Language Mastery with a Language, you can't read, write, speak or understand it.

## Combat Mastery

Combat Mastery represents your experience in dealing with dangers and overcoming adversaries in Combat. You have Combat Mastery with the following:

- Attack Checks and Spell Checks
- Precision Defense and Area Defense
- Attribute Saves and Save DC

**DC Tip:** You don't have Combat Mastery with Death Saves, so those Saves don't add your CM.

## Combat Mastery Formula

1/2 your Character's Level (rounded up)

## Combat Training

Combat Training represents your proficiency with using equipment effectively in Combat. You can gain Combat Training with the following types of equipment: Weapons, Armor, and Shields.

## Gaining Combat Training

Martial Classes grant Weapon Training.

All Classes grant you Armor Training. Some Classes (such as the Champion), Ancestry Traits (such as Natural Combatant), or Talents (such as Martial Expansion) grant you Weapon or Shield Training.

## Lacking Combat Training

You suffer the following penalties while wearing or wielding the following equipment that you lack Training with:

- **Weapons:** While wielding a Weapon in which you lack Combat Training, you don't benefit from its Weapon Style.
- **Armor:** While wearing Armor in which you lack Combat Training, you have DisADV on Attack Checks and Spell Checks.
- **Shields:** While wielding a Shield in which you lack Training, you have DisADV on Attack Checks and Spell Checks.

## Checks & Saves

Whenever an attempt is made by a creature to perform an action that has a chance of success and failure, they make a Check or a Save to determine the outcome of the attempt. The type of action the creature is attempting to perform determines whether they make a Check or a Save. When a creature makes a Check or Save, they roll a d20 and add any relevant bonuses which are determined by the type of Check or Save.

**Checks:** When a PC initiates an action against another creature or obstacle, the GM might ask them to make a Check to determine if the activity is successful. The GM might also ask for a Check to be made when two or more creatures are engaging in a competition of skill against each other.

**Saves:** When a PC reacts against an effect being forced upon them, the GM might ask them to make a Save to determine if they're successful at resisting the effect.

**Example:** A Might Check would be to see if you can lift the heavy boulder that's just sitting there, while a Might Save would be to see is you can stop a heavy boulder that's rolling down a hill at you!

**Willing Creatures:** Any creature can choose to fail a Check or Save. When they do, treat the result of their Check or Save as a 0 for the purposes of degrees of success or failure (see 'Check & Save Outcomes' on page 29), but the creature doesn't suffer the effects of a Critical Failure unless they choose to do so.

## Types of Checks

There are several types of Checks a GM might ask a creature to make, such as an Attack Check when attacking with a Weapon, a Spell Check when casting a Spell, a specific Skill Check when performing a test of skill, a specific Trade Check when performing a test of professional expertise, or a specific Flat Attribute Check performing a test of aptitude that doesn't benefit from skill or expertise.

**Flat Attribute Checks:** When a creature attempts to perform an activity that doesn't benefit from Mastery, they make a certain type of Flat Attribute Check, such as a Flat Might Check to lift a very heavy object or a Flat Intelligence Check to remember a conversation they once had.

**Attack Checks:** When a creature attempts to hit a target with an Unarmed Strike or Weapon, they make an Attack Check to determine if their attack hits the target.

**Spell Checks:** When a creature casts a Spell, they make a Spell Check to determine the potency of the Spell or if the Spell hits its target.

**Skill Checks:** When a creature attempts a test of skill, they might perform a Skill Check, such as an Influence Check to determine how convincing your argument is, or a Trickery Check to determine if you can pocket an item without being noticed. See the 'Skills' on page 11 for more information.

**Trade Checks:** When a creature attempts a test of professional expertise, they might perform a Trade Check, such as a Blacksmithing Check to determine the result of their efforts crafting a Weapon, or a Theater Check to determine how well an audience responds to their performance. See the 'Trades List' on page 14 for more information.

**Language Checks:** These are used to see how well you can read, write, or speak using a language you have Limited Language Mastery in. You add your Charisma or Intelligence (your choice) to these Checks.

## Types of Saves

A creature can make a Save to resist an effect imposed against it by another creature, a trap, or an environmental hazard. The type of effect will determine which type of Save the creature makes: Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence.

**Might Saves:** Resist effects that push you away, knock you down, or crush you.

**Agility Saves:** Resist effects that cause you to lose your balance or that can be avoided by successfully dodging out of the way.

**Charisma Saves:** Resist effects that attempt to dominate your mind or alter your emotions.

**Intelligence Saves:** Resist effects that attempt to read your thoughts, alter your memories, confuse you, or use illusions to deceive your senses.

## Checks

## Flat Attribute Checks

When a creature performs a task that doesn't benefit from Mastery, it makes a Flat Attribute Check (Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence). To make a Flat Attribute Check, roll a d20 and add the associated Attribute to the result.

## Flat Attribute Check Formula

d20 + Attribute

**Example:** A GM might ask a PC to make a Flat Agility Check to see how flexible they are or a Flat Charisma Check to determine the first impression they make upon entering a room. If the PC's Charisma is 4, they roll a d20 and add 4 to the result.

## Attack Checks

A creature can make an Attack Check when it takes the Attack Action or uses a Feature that calls for one. A creature must be wielding a Weapon or be capable of an Unarmed Strike to make an Attack Check. When a creature makes an Attack Check, it rolls a d20 then adds its Prime Modifier and Combat Mastery to determine the result.

## Attack Check Formula

d20 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery

**Example:** A Level 4 Barbarian's highest Attribute is a 3 (Prime Modifier) and their Combat Mastery is 2 (1/2 its level). When the Barbarian makes an Attack Check, they roll a d20 and add 5 (2+3). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result of the Attack Check is 15 (10 + 5).

**DC Tip:** Attack Checks are most often used when making Martial Attacks (see 'Attacks & Defenses' on page 31 for more information).

## Spell Checks

A creature can make a Spell Check when it takes the Spell Action to cast a Spell or uses a Feature that calls for one. When a creature makes a Spell Check, it rolls a d20, then adds its Prime Modifier and Combat Mastery to determine the result.

## Spell Check Formula

d20 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery

**Example:** A Level 6 Wizard's highest Attribute is 4 (Prime Modifier) and has a Combat Mastery of 3 (1/2 its level). When the Wizard makes a Spell Check, they roll a d20 and add 7 (4+3). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result of the Spell Check is 17 (10 + 7).

**DC Tip:** Spell Checks are most often used when Casting a Spell ( see 'Spellcasting' on page 54 for more information). Spell Checks are made against Defenses (Spell Attacks), Spell DCs, and Saves.

## Skill Checks

When a creature attempts a test of skill, the GM might have them make a Skill Check to determine whether they succeed or fail. The GM will choose the Skill to use with the Check based on the activity attempted.

## Making a Skill Check

To make a Skill Check, a creature rolls a d20, adds their Skill Mastery in the given Skill (if any), and adds the Attribute associated with the Skill. The result of the Skill Check is compared to the DC set by the GM. If the result of the Skill Check is equal to or higher than the DC, then the Check is successful.

## Skill Check Formula

d20 + Attribute + Skill Mastery

**Example:** A Level 4 Hunter's Agility Attribute is 3 and their Skill Mastery in Stealth is Novice (+2). When the Hunter makes a Stealth Check to attempt to avoid being detected by other creatures, they roll a d20 and add 5 (3+2) to the result.

**DC Tip:** Each Skill has a Base Attribute that is the 'default' Attribute you would use for a given Check. See 'Lacking Skill Mastery' on page 20 in the Game Master Guide for more custom options for what Attributes can be used in creative ways with different Skills.

## Trade Checks

When a creature attempts a test of professional expertise, the GM might have them make a Trade Check to determine whether they succeed or fail. The GM will choose the Trade to use with the Check based on the activity attempted.

## Making a Trade Check

To make a Trade Check, a creature rolls a d20, adds their Trade Mastery in the given Trade (if any), and adds the Attribute associated with the Trade. The result of the Trade Check is compared to the DC set by the GM. If the result of the Trade Check is equal to or higher than the DC, then the Check is successful.

## Trade Check Formula

d20 + Attribute + Trade Mastery

**Example:** A Level 5 Artificer's Might Attribute is a 4 and their Trade Mastery in Blacksmithing is Adept (+4). When the Artificer makes a Blacksmithing Check to attempt to use Blacksmithing Tools to forge something, they roll a d20 and add 8 (4+4) to the result.

## Trade Tools

A creature must use the specified Trade Tools when attempting a Trade Check (see 'Trades' on page 14 for more information on Trade Tools). If a creature attempts a Trade Check using tools not designed for the task (such as using a hair pin instead of Lockpicking Tools to pick a lock), they have Disadvantage on the Trade Check.

## Language Checks

When you are trying to read, write, or speak in a language you have Limited Language Mastery in, you can make a Language Check to do so. Roll a d20 and add your Charisma or Intelligence (your choice).

## Language Check Formula

d20 + (Intelligence or Charisma)

**Language Check DC:** The DC of a Language Check is determined by the type of language. DC 10 for Mortal, DC 15 for Exotic and Divine, and DC 20 for Outer.

**DC Tip:** The GM will set a DC based on how hard it would be to read, write, or speak that language. The Halfling language would be easier to understand than Deep Speech for example.

## Special Checks

## Check Contests

When a creature makes a Check against an opposing creature's Check (or Save), they are engaged in a Contest. The creature with the highest Check result is the winner of the Contest. If a Contest results in a tie, then the situation remains unchanged.

**Example:** A Barbarian attempts to push a Rogue. If the Barbarian's Check is higher than the Rogue's Check, then the Rogue is pushed. If the Barbarian's Check is lower than the Rogue's Check, then the Rogue is not pushed. If the Barbarian's Check is equal to the Rogue's Check, then the Rogue is not pushed.

## Check Categories

Checks are organized into categories, such as: Attribute Checks, Physical Checks, Mental Checks, and Martial Checks. Some Checks fall within multiple Check Categories.

## Attribute Checks

An Attribute Check includes any Check that uses an Attribute, such as:

**Might Checks:** Flat Might Checks, Athletics Checks, and Intimidation Checks.

**Agility Checks:** Flat Agility Checks, Acrobatics Checks, Trickery Checks, and Stealth Checks.

**Charisma Checks:** Flat Charisma Checks, Animal Checks, Influence Checks, and Insight Checks.

**Intelligence Checks:** Flat Intelligence Checks, Investigation Checks, Medicine Checks, and Survival Checks.

## Physical Checks

A Physical Check includes any Check that requires a creature's physicality to perform, such as Might Checks, Agility Checks, and Attack Checks.

## Mental Checks

A Mental Check includes any Check that requires a creature's focus to perform, such as Charisma Checks, Intelligence Checks, and Spell Checks.

## Martial Checks

When a creature performs a task that can benefit from either an Acrobatics or Athletics Check, the GM might call for a Martial Check instead. When a creature makes a Martial Check, it can choose to make an Acrobatics Check or an Athletics Check.

## Passive Skills

Sometimes a GM might not ask a PC to roll any dice to determine the success of a Check. Instead, the GM would use the PC's average result for that type of Check. Every Skill has a Passive value, such as Passive Awareness, Passive Insight, and Passive Athletics. The value of a Passive Skill is equal to 10 + all bonuses normally applied to its Check.

**DC Tip:** These Passive Skills are used when the PC is not actively performing this action or it's being done over a longer period of time. This number represents their 'Average' ability at each Check.

## Passive Skill Formula

10 + All Bonuses

**Example:** A Level 1 Champion has 2 Levels of Mastery (+4 bonus) in Awareness, and its highest Attribute is 3 (Prime Attribute). Normally it would make an Awareness Check by rolling a d20 and adding 7 (4+3) to the Check, however its Passive Awareness would instead by 17 (10+7). If a Rogue attempts to sneak by the Champion (while they aren't actively looking), the Rogue would have to succeed a DC 17 Stealth Check to avoid being detected.

## Permanent ADV and DisADV

If you have an effect that grants you a permanent ADV or DisADV to a Skill Check, then you add (ADV) or subtract (DisADV) 2 to your Passive Skill for each instance of ADV or DisADV.

**Example:** The Commander has Heavy Armor and has DisADV on all Stealth Checks they make. Since this is a permanent effect (as long as they're wearing that armor), you would also subtract 2 from the Commander's Passive Stealth Skill.

## Saves

Many Saves in DC20 target one of a creature's 4 Attributes Saves (Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence).

## Attribute Saves

When a creature is subjected to an effect, they make the an Attribute Save to determine whether or not they're able to resist the effect. The Attribute used to make the Save is determined by the effect (or the GM).

## Making an Attribute Save

The creature rolls a d20, adds its given Attribute, and adds its Combat Mastery. If the result of the Attribute Save is equal to or higher than the Contested Check, the Attribute Save is successful.

## Attribute Save Formula

d20 + Attribute + Combat Mastery

**Example (Might Save):** A level 2 Barbarian that attempts to resist being pushed against their will would make a Might Save to prevent themselves from moving.Their Might is 3 and their Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) is 1, so their total bonus to the Save is a 4. They would roll a d20 and add 4 to their Might Save.

**Example (Agility Save):** A level 5 Rogue that attempts to jump to safety when the ground beneath their feet collapses would make an Agility Save to secure its footing on solid ground. Their Agility is 4 and their Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) is 3, so their total bonus to the Save is a 7. They would roll a d20 and add 7 to their Agility Save.

**Example (Charisma Save):** A level 10 Bard that attempts to resist being mind controlled would make a Charisma Save to retain control over their own actions. Their Charisma is 5 and their Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) is 5, so their total bonus to the Save is a 10. They would roll a d20 and add 10 to their Charisma Save.

**Example (Intelligence Save):** A level 16 Wizard that attempts to break free of illusions that grip their senses would make an Intelligence Save to discern what's real and what isn't. Their Intelligence is 6 and their Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) is 8, so their total bonus to the Save is a 14. They would roll a d20 and add 14 to their Intelligence Save.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Special Saves

## Death Saves

When a creature makes a Death Save, it rolls a d20. If the result is 10 or higher it succeeds on its Death Save. See 'Death's Door' on page 33 for more information on Death Saves.

## Save Categories

Some Saves are organized into categories, such as Physical Saves, Mental Saves, and Death Saves.

**Physical Saves:** When an effect targets your overall physical abilities, you make a Physical Save. Your Physical Save bonus is equal to your Might Save bonus or Agility Save bonus, whichever is higher.

**Example:** A creature that attempts to resist gaining Exhaustion from a Spell that withers its body would make a Physical Save to avoid suffering any effects.

**Mental Saves:** When an effect targets your overall mental abilities, you make a Mental Save. Your Mental Save bonus is equal to your Charisma Save bonus or Intelligence Save bonus, whichever is higher.

**Example:** A creature that attempts to resist being teleported against its will would make a Mental Save to remain in the same location.

## Save DC

Your Save DC represents the difficulty a creature would have to resist your static effects (such as Traps) and ongoing effects (such as Spells). Every creature has a Save DC, which is equal to 10 + its Prime Modifier + its Combat Mastery.

## Save DC Formula

10 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery

**Repeated Saves:** When a creature fails a Save against an effect that has the Repeated Save statement, it can repeat its Save at the end of each of its turns. When that happens, the creature repeats its Save against a Save DC (instead of the original opposing Check).

**Example:** A Giant Snake targets a Barbarian with a Melee Attack that causes the target to become Restrained. The Giant Snake makes an Attack Check that's Contested by the Barbarian's Physical Save. If the Barbarian fails its Save against the effect it becomes Restrained. However, the Barbarian can repeat its Save at the end of each of its turns to free itself from being Restrained. When it repeats its Save it does so against the Giant Snake's Save DC.

## Dynamic Attack Saves

Some game features (such as a Maneuvers, Techniques, Spells, etc.) both deal damage and impose an effect on its target. This triggers what is called a Dynamic Attack Save.

The provoking creature makes an Attack Check (or Spell Check) at the same time that the target makes its Save. The provoking creature's Check is compared against the target's Defense to determine if the target takes damage, and the target's Save is compared against the provoking creature's Save DC to determine if the target is subjected to the effect.

## Dynamic Attack Save Outcomes

A Dynamic Attack Save can result in 1 of 4 outcomes:

- **Attack Hit & Save Failure:** The target takes damage and is subjected to the effect.
- **Attack Miss & Save Failure:** The target does not take damage but is subjected to the effect.
- **Attack Hit & Save Success:** The target takes damage but is not subjected to the effect.
- **Attack Miss & Save Success:** The target does not take damage and is not subjected to the effect.

**DC Tip:** There are many game features that both deal damage and impose an effect on its target. When this happens, an Attack Check or Spell Check is ALWAYS made to determine DAMAGE while a Save is ALWAYS made against the EFFECT. This opens up many very interesting interactions on what the outcome will be and keeps things moving quickly because both the Attacker and the Target make these rolls at the same time (similar to how Contested Checks work). With Dynamic Attack Saves, you don't have to wait for the Attack Check to hit, then have the target make a Save, they both happen at the same time.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

When a creature has Advantage (ADV) on a Check or Save, it rolls two d20 and takes the highest number rolled across both dice. If the creature has Disadvantage (DisADV) instead, it takes the lowest number across both dice.

**Example:** A creature has ADV on a Check. Normally it would roll a single d20 when making the Check, but because it has ADV it rolls two d20 instead and takes the highest number rolled.

## Gaining Advantage

When a creature makes a Check or Save, it can spend 1 or more AP to gain ADV on its Check or Save per AP spent (see 'Action Points' on page 39 for more information).

**Example:** A Barbarian chooses to make an Attack with a Greatmaul against a creature. The Barbarian can spend 1 AP to grant themselves ADV on their Attack Check.

## Stacking ADV or DisADV

Sometimes a creature might have multiple sources of ADV (or DisADV) on a single Check or Save.

**ADV X:** If a creature has multiple instances of ADV on a Check or Save, it has ADV X where X represents the number of additional dice the creature rolls when making the Check or Save. The creature rolls 1 additional d20 for each ADV it has on the Check or Save, and takes the highest number across all dice.

**Example:** A creature has ADV 2 on a Check. It rolls a d20 plus 2 additional d20 (3 total dice) and takes the highest number rolled across all of the dice.

**DisADV X:** If a creature has multiple instances of DisADV on a Check or Save, it has DisADV X where X represents the number of additional dice the creature rolls when making the Check or Save. The creature rolls 1 additional d20 for each DisADV it has on the Check or Save, and takes the lowest number across all dice.

**Example:** A creature has DisADV 3 on a Check. It rolls a d20 plus 3 additional d20 (4 total dice) and takes the lowest number rolled across all of the dice.

**DC Tip:** ADV 1 and DisADV 1 is the same thing as 'regular' ADV and DisADV. When rolling a d20 to make a Check or Save, the 1 just represents the 1 additional d20 you're rolling, which is what happens with regular ADV and DisADV. Most of the time they'll simply be referred to as ADV and DisADV.

## Combining ADV & DisADV

If a creature has both ADV and DisADV at the same time, each instance cancels out. If they all cancel out, the creature makes a standard d20 roll as usual. If there are any remaining ADV or DisADV, then it makes the roll with whatever ADV (or DisADV) is left over.

**Example 1:** If a creature had both ADV and DisADV then that would become a standard roll of a single d20. If you had DisADV 3 and also had ADV, then one of the ADV would cancel out one of the DisADV and you would be left with DisADV 2.

**Example 2:** If a creature has both DisADV 3 and and ADV 2 on a Check, two of the ADV cancel out two of the DisADV, leaving only one DisADV remaining. The Check is then made with DisADV 1, which is just regular DisADV (rolling 2 dice and taking the lower number).

**DC Tip:** Basically just subtract any ADV or DisADV from each other and see what you are left with, and if the answer is ever 0, then you just make a standard d20 roll.

## Variable ADV & DisADV

Gaining ADV and DisADV on Checks made against other creatures is very common. Sometimes you might have to make a Check against a group of creatures where you have ADV or DisADV on the Check against some of the targets but not all of them. When that happens, follow these steps below:

1. Make a Check against all targets you don't have ADV or DisADV against by rolling a single d20 and adding any relevant bonuses you have on the Check against the targets.
2. For any additional targets you have ADV or DisADV against, roll a second d20 and compare it to the first d20 you already rolled. For all targets you have ADV against, choose the higher number rolled, and for DisADV choose the lower number rolled.
3. (Optional) If you have ADV/DisADV 2 or higher against any additional targets, repeat Step 2 for each additional dice you have to roll until you resolve the outcome of your Check against all targets.

**Example:** A Wizard targets 3 creatures with a Fireball Spell. It doesn't have ADV against the first target (rolls 1d20), has ADV against the second target (rolls 2d20), and ADV 2 against the third target (rolls 3d20). The Wizard rolls a d20 and uses it to determine the outcome of its Spell Check against the first target. It then rolls another d20 and compares it to the first d20 (total of 2d20s) to determine the outcome of its Spell Check against the second target. It then rolls another d20 and compares it to the first 2 d20s (total of 3d20s) to determine the outcome of its Spell Check against the third target.

## Multiple Check Penalty

During Combat, each time a creature makes the same Check before the end of its turn, they suffer stacking DisADV on that type of Check, such as specific Flat Attribute Checks (Flat Might, Flat Agility, Flat Charisma, Flat Intelligence), Attack Checks, Spell Checks, and specific Skill Checks (Stealth, Athletics, Influence, etc.), and specific Trade Checks (Theatre, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, etc.). This penalty only applies to Checks made during the creature's turn, and doesn't apply to Reactions taken on another creature's turn (unless otherwise stated).

- **1st Attempt:** Normal roll.
- **2nd Attempt:** DisADV 1 (roll 2 dice and take the lowest result).
- **3rd Attempt:** DisADV 2 (roll 3 dice and take the lowest result).
- **4th Attempt:** DisADV 3 (roll 4 dice and take the lowest result).

**Example:** If a creature casts a Spell by making a Spell Check, its first attempt would be a normal roll, but subsequent Spells would have stacking DisADV (as shown above).

**DC Tip:** The Multiple Check Penalty does not apply outside of Combat. See 'Action Points' on page 39 and 'Mana Points' on page 40 for more information on how Actions are taken outside of Combat.

**Multiple Action Penalties:** Some Actions have penalties when you take it multiple times, such as the Help Action. These penalties count as the Multiple Check Penalty for the purposes of game mechanics that apply to Multiple Check Penalties.

## Check & Save Outcomes

## Critical Success & Failure

When a creature rolls a 20 on a d20, the Check or Save gains a Critical Success. When a creature rolls a 1 on a d20, the Check or Save suffers a Critical Failure. A Critical Success or Critical Failure can affect the outcome in different ways, as determined by the type of Check or Save being made.

## Attack Checks & Spell Checks

## Critical Success

**Attack & Spell Checks:** When a creature gains a Critical Success on an Attack Check or Spell Check that deals damage, the Attack is considered a Critical Hit (automatically hits and deals +2 damage). If it's an Attack Check or Spell Check that doesn't deal damage, the Check automatically succeeds even if the result would normally fail.

## Critical Failure

**Attack Checks:** When a creature suffers a Critical Failure on an Attack Check that deals damage, the attack automatically misses even if the result would normally hit. If its an Attack Check that doesn't deal damage, the Check automatically fails even if the result would normally succeed.

**Spell Checks:** When a creature suffers a Critical Failure on a Spell Check to cast a Spell (or other similar effect), it fails to cast. When the Critical Failure happens, the AP spent is lost, but any other resources (such as MP or material components) are not spent.

**Attack & Spell Checks:** Additionally, a creature that suffers a Critical Failure on an Attack Check or Spell Check becomes Exposed (Attack Checks made against it have ADV) against the next Attack made against it before the start of its next turn.

**DC Tip:** For Critical Failures, the GM could change the Condition to Hindered (your next Attack Check has DisADV) instead of Exposed at their discretion.

<!-- image -->

## Saves, Skill Checks, & Trade Checks

## Critical Success

When a creature gains a Critical Success on a Save, Skill Check, or Trade Check, the Check or Save automatically succeeds even if the result would normally fail.

## Critical Failure

When a creature suffers a Critical Failure on a Save, Skill Check, or Trade Check, the Check or Save automatically fails even if the result would normally succeed.

**DC Tip:** The GM should avoid asking PCs to make Checks where success shouldn't be possible. If a PC ties a heavy chain around a building, it shouldn't be possible for them to succeed on a Might Check to drag the building. Conversely, the GM should avoid asking PCs to make Checks where failure shouldn't be possible, like asking a PC to make a Might Check pick up a pebble. Unless the circumstances introduce the possibility of success or failure, try to refrain from asking for Checks for activities that are impossible to succeed or fail. Mistakes are going to happen and GMs might ask for a roll when they shouldn't have. The final outcome of a Critical Success or Critical Failure are up to the GM, and PCs should respect that.

## Contested Critical Outcomes

When multiple creatures gain a Critical Success in a contest (or all creatures suffer a Critical Failure), the creature with the highest total result wins the contest.

## Degrees of Success & Failure

## Degrees of Success

If a creature succeeds on a Check or Save by 5 or more, they may gain additional benefits beyond those of a normal success. The Check or Save will include a success statement, such as **Success**, **Success (5)**, **Success (10)**, or **Success (each 5)**.

## Success

If the success statement says **Success** then the creature gains the listed benefits if the result of its Check or Save is equal to or higher than the opposing DC, Check, or Save.

## Success (each 5)

If a success statement says **Success (each 5)** then the creature gains the listed benefits for every 5 the result of its Check or Save is above the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Unless stated otherwise, the creature can gain the additional benefits multiple times.

**Example:** A Spell pushes a target back 3 Spaces on a successful Spell Check, but also includes the following success statement: '**Success (each 5):** +1 Space.' That means that each 5 points the Spell Check is above the opposing DC, Check, or Save, the target is pushed 1 additional Space.

## Success (5) & Success (10)

If a success statement says **Success (5)** then the creature gains the listed benefits when they succeed by 5 or more above the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Moreover, if the success statement says **Success (10)** then they also gain the listed benefits when they succeed by 10 or more above the opposing DC, Check, or Save. This can continue on to **Success (15)** and further.

**Example:** A Spell increases a creature's Speed by 1 on a successful Spell Check, but has the following success statements: '**Success (5):** Ignore Difficult Terrain,' and '**Success (10):** Immune to Slowed.' That means that the creature's Speed is increased by 1 and ignores Difficult Terrain if its Spell Check is 5 above the Spell's DC, and the creature is also immune to the Slowed Condition if its Spell Check is 10 above the Spell's DC.

## Degrees of Failure

If a creature fails on a Check or Save by 5 or more, they may suffer additional penalties beyond those of a normal failure. The Check or Save will include a failure statement, such as **Failure**, **Failure (5)**, **Failure (10)**, or **Failure (each 5)**.

## Failure

If a failure statement says **Failure** then the creature suffers the listed penalties if the result of its Check or Save is below than the opposing DC, Check, or Save.

## Failure (each 5)

If a failure statement says **Failure (each 5)** then the creature suffers the listed penalties for every 5 the result of its Check or Save is below the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Unless stated otherwise, the creature can suffer the additional penalties multiple times.

**Example:** A trap deals 4 Fire damage to a target on a failed Save, but also includes the following failure statement: '**Failure (each 5):** +1 damage.' That means that each 5 points the Save is below the Trap's Save DC, the target takes an additional +1 Fire damage.

## Failure (5) & Failure (10)

If a failure statement says **Failure (5)** then the creature suffers the listed penalties when they fail by 5 or more below the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Moreover, if the failure statement says **Failure (10)** then they also suffer the listed penalties when they fail by 10 or more below the opposing DC, Check, or Save. This can continue on to **Failure (15)** and further.

**Example:** A Curse imposes the Blinded Condition on a failed Save, but has the following failure statements: '**Failure (5):** Deafened,' and '**Failure (10):** Doomed.' That means that the creature is both Blinded and Deafened if its Save is 5 below the Save DC, and the creature is also Doomed 1 if its Save is 10 below the Save DC.

## Attacks & Defenses

## Attacks

When a creature makes an Attack, it can do so by choosing a target within the Attack's Range (Melee or Ranged) and by making a Check (Attack or Spell). How the Attack is resolved is determined by its Type and its Range.

## Attack Types

There are 2 types of Attacks: **Martial** and **Spell**.

## Martial Attacks

A creature makes a Martial Attack when they make an Attack Check using a Weapon or Unarmed Strike against a target's Defense.

**Unarmed Strike:** A Martial Attack made using any part of a creature's own body, such as a Punch, Elbow, Kick, Knee, or Headbutt.

**Weapon Attack:** A Martial Attack made using a Weapon, such as an Axe, Sword, or Bow. You can draw a Weapon as part of an Attack made using it.

## Spell Attacks

A creature makes a Spell Attack when they make a Spell Check against a target's Defense. See 'Spell Check vs Defense' on page 56 for more information.

## Attack Ranges

There are 2 types of Attack Ranges: **Melee** and **Ranged**.

## Melee Attack

When a creature makes a Melee Attack they can do so against a target within its Melee Range. A creature's Melee Range is 1 Space, unless otherwise stated.

## Ranged Attack

When a creature makes a Ranged Attack they can do so against a target within its Range. The Range is determined by the type of Weapon it's Attacking with or by consulting the Feature or Spell its using to make the Ranged Attack.

**Close Quarters:** Ranged Attacks have Disadvantage if an enemy is within 1 Space of you, provided the enemy isn't Incapacitated.

## Weapon Ranges

A Weapon that can be used to make a Ranged Attack has a Range shown in parentheses after its Ammo, Toss, or Thrown property (see 'Weapons' on page 75).

**Normal Range:** The first number in the parentheses is a Weapon's normal range. You can make an attack against any target within this range.

**Long Range:** The second number in the parentheses is a Weapon's long range. You can make an attack with Disadvantage against targets within this range.

You can't make attacks against targets beyond your Weapon's long range.

**Example:** A Short Bow with a range of (15/45) means that it can be used to make attacks against targets between 1 and 15 Spaces, attacks with Disadvantage against targets between 16 and 45 Spaces, and can't attack targets that are 46 Spaces or farther away.

## Determining if an Attack Hits

When a creature makes an Attack, the result of the Attack Check or Spell Check is compared to the target's Defense to determine whether or not the Attack Hits the target. The Attack Hits if the result of the Attack Check is equal to or greater than the target's Defense.

**Example:** A Level 4 Champion's highest Attribute is a 3 (Prime Modifier) and their Combat Mastery is 2 (1/2 its level). When the Champion makes an Attack Check using a Longsword, they roll a d20 and add 5 (2+3). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result is 15 (10 + 5). If the target's PD is 15 or lower, the Attack Hits, otherwise it Misses.

<!-- image -->

## Defenses

When a creature makes an Attack (see the 'Combat Actions Sidebar' on page 39) to attempt to deal damage to a target, the creature's Check is compared against the value of one of the target's Defenses (Precision Defense or Area Defense) to determine if the Attack hits.

## Precision Defense

Precision Defense (PD) measures a creature's ability to avoid attacks that can be dodged, such as a precise strike or a ranged projectile. It reflects a combination of reflexes and tactical foresight, making it a crucial defense against single-target assaults.

## PD Calculation

Your PD is equal to 8 plus your Combat Mastery, Agility, and Intelligence. If you are wearing Armor or wielding a Shield (see 'Equipment' on page 75), you also add their respective bonuses to your PD.

- **Agility:** Represents your reaction speed and physical swiftness, allowing you to evade incoming attacks.
- **Intelligence:** Reflects your ability to anticipate danger and position yourself wisely, giving you the time needed to react.

## PD Formula

8 + Combat Mastery + Agility + Intelligence + Bonuses

## Area Defense

Area Defense (AD) measures a creature's ability to withstand attacks that can't be avoided, such as explosions, shockwaves, or other widespread effects. Instead of relying on dodging, Area Defense reflects raw endurance, resilience, and sheer force of will to endure the assault.

## AD Calculation

Your AD is equal to 8 plus your Combat Mastery, Might, and Charisma. If you are wearing Armor or wielding a Shield (see 'Equipment' on page 75), you also add their respective bonuses to your AD.

- **Might:** Represents your physical toughness and endurance, allowing you to absorb and resist bodily harm.
- **Charisma:** Reflects your inner resolve and commanding presence, reinforcing your ability to withstand mental and supernatural assaults.

## AD Formula

8 + Combat Mastery + Might + Charisma + Bonuses

## Health Points & Death's Door

## Health Points

Health Points (HP) are a game statistic representing a creature's ability to sustain damage. The stronger the creature the more HP it generally has, signifying the greater difficulty in defeating it.

**Example:** A Commoner has 4 HP, a Mastiff has 3 HP, a Cat has 2 HP and a Rat has 1 HP.

**DC Tip:** Most damage a creature takes is nonlethal-it just 'wears them down' until they get closer and closer to Death's Door. Lighter hits might graze you, while bigger hits knock you off your feet. The description and roleplay of how damage is taken can change depending on its source and the situation, but Health Points represent how much of a beating you can take before you die.

## Health Points at 1st Level

A PC has a number of Health Points equal to Class HP + Might. A PC might also gain additional HP from its Ancestry, such the Dwarf Trait Tough (+1 HP) or the Elf Trait Frail (-2 HP).

## Health Point Formula

Class HP + Might + Ancestry HP (if any)

**Example:** A PC picks the Champion Class at Level 1 and starts with a Might of 3 (the highest possible at Level 1). The Champion Class grants a base of 9 HP. The PC then adds +3 HP from their Might to get a total of 12 HP (9 + 3). If any of their Ancestry Traits increase or decrease their HP, they would add those to the total to determine their starting HP.

## Temporary Health Points

Temporary Health Points (Temp HP) are additional Health Points that persist for a limited duration. When you take damage, your Temp HP is reduced first, and then any remaining damage carries over to reduce your HP.

**Stacking:** Temp HP doesn't stack. If you gain Temp HP from different effects, you choose which effect to gain Temp HP from, and ignore the Temp HP granted by the other effects.

**Duration:** Temp HP lasts until you complete a Long Rest or its reduced to 0 by taking damage. An effect that grants Temp HP may state a shorter duration, such as 1 minute, until you complete a Quick Rest or Short Rest, or some other duration. When the duration expires, all Temp HP gained immediately vanish.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Health Thresholds

Certain game mechanics affect creatures while their current HP is within certain thresholds. These HP thresholds are determined before any temporary changes to your HP maximum, such as from the Doomed Condition or the Aid Spell.

- **Bloodied:** HP is equal to or lower than 1/2 its maximum HP.
- **Well-Bloodied:** HP is equal to or lower than 1/4 its maximum HP.
- **Death's Door:** HP is equal to or lower than 0 HP, to a minimum of its Death Threshold.

A creature's Death Threshold is equal to 0 HP minus its Prime Modifier and its Combat Mastery.

**DC Tip:** If a creature is on Death's Door, they are still considered to be Bloodied and Well-Bloodied, because their HP is still below 1/2 their maximum (Bloodied) and 1/4 their maximum (Well-Bloodied).

**Example:** A creature with a maximum HP of 8 is considered Bloodied when its HP is 4 or lower, Well-Bloodied when its HP is 2 or lower, and on Death's Door when its HP is 0 or lower. If its Prime Modifier is 3 and its Combat Mastery is 1, the creature's Death Threshold is -4 HP. That creature dies if its HP is ever reduced to -4 HP or lower.

## Death's Door

When a PC is reduced to 0 HP they're on 'Death's Door' and fighting for their life. This is represented in whatever way the player wants to describe this state looks like for their character. They are NOT unconscious, they are in a heavily weakened state about to die if something is not done SOON! They could be prone crawling on the ground, holding themselves up with their sword, or spitting out blood as they hold on for dear life.

## Entering Death's Door

When you're reduced to 0 HP or lower, you gain Exhaustion 1. Until you are restored to 1 HP or higher, you suffer the following effects:

- **Action Point Limit:** Your current and maximum AP are reduced by 3.
- **Death Save:** You must make a DC 10 Death Save at the start of each of your turns (see Death Saves for more information).

**DC Tip:** You basically can only spend 1 AP per round of Combat, either on your turn or as a Reaction. This usually happens while on Death's Door.

## Death Saves

When a creature makes a Death Save, it rolls a d20 to determine if it Succeeds or Fails the Save.

## Success

- **Success:** No change.
- **Success (5):** You regain 1 HP.
- **Critical Success:** You are restored to 1 HP.

## Failure

- **Failure:** You gain Bleeding 1.
- **Failure (5):** You gain Bleeding 2 instead.
- **Critical Failure:** You also fall Unconscious until you're restored to 1 HP or higher.

**DC Tip:** If you are on Death's Door outside of Combat, you repeat the Death Save every 12 seconds instead (5 times per minute).

## Death's Door Sidebar

## Bleeding X (Condition)

You take X True damage at the start of each of your turns.

**Ending Bleeding:** All stacks of the Condition end when you're subjected to an effect that restores your HP. Alternatively, a creature can attempt to remove 1 or more stacks of the Condition by taking the Medicine Action.

## Medicine (Action)

You can spend 1 AP to touch a creature and tend to its wounds. Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. **Success:** You end 1 stack of Bleeding on the target. **Success (each 5):** You end an additional stack of Bleeding.

## First Aid Kit (Equipment)

You can spend 1 Charge and take the Object Action to treat a Bloodied creature's wounds (see First Aid Kit for more information). Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. **Success:** Target creature regains 1 HP. **Success (each 5):** The creature regains +1 HP.

## NPC's on Death's Door

Monsters and NPCs normally die when they're reduced to 0 HP, however the Game Master can choose to implement Death's Door on special enemies. They would drop down to 1 AP and be on Death's Door in that same weakened state, leaving a window for them to still talk to the party and get out any last words before someone puts them out of their misery.

## Damage

## Degrees of Damage

Each Attack has a base amount of damage that's dealt on a Hit. This value is listed alongside the Weapon (see 'Equipment' on page 75) or in the Spell's description (see 'Spellcasting' on page 54). If the Check beats the targets Defense by 5 or more, the target takes extra damage and may suffer additional effects (see 'Check & Save Outcomes' on page 29 for more information).

## Hit & Miss

When you make a Check against a target's Defense, the Check is considered a **Miss** if the result is below the target's Defense and it's considered a **Hit** if the result is equal to or above the target's Defense.

## Hit Success (each 5)

An Attack deals +1 additional damage for every 5 the result of the Check is above the target's Defense. If the result of the Check is 5 or more above the target's Defense, it is considered a **Heavy Hit**. If the result of the Check is 10 or more above the target's Defense, it is considered a **Brutal Hit**. Brutal Hits are considered Heavy Hits for purposes of effects that trigger on a Heavy Hit.

**DC Tip:** Heavy Hits are 5 over, Brutal Hits are 10 over, but if a Character ever manages to get 15 over a target's Defense I call this Beyond Brutal. Then I count by 5s to see how many instances of +1 bonus damage they get.

## Degrees of Damage Table

The table below shows how the damage of an Attack can change as determined by the result of the Check.

| Check vs Defense | Result | Damage |
|---|---|---|
| Lower | Miss | No Damage |
| Equal or greater | Hit | Base Damage |
| +5 or greater | Heavy Hit | Base Damage + 1 |
| +10 or greater | Brutal Hit | Base Damage + 2 |

## Critical Hits

When you roll a 20 on a d20 for an Attack, it's considered a Critical Hit. A Critical Hit automatically Hits the target, bypasses Damage Reduction, and deals an additional +2 damage.

**DC Tip:** An Attack can score a Critical Hit without the result of the Check being 5 or more above the target's Defense. When that happens, the Check is considered a Critical Hit and the target simply takes the base damage +2, however, this scenario is rare. A Critical Hit will normally result in a Check that's 5 or even 10 above the target's Defense, causing the target to take +2 damage from the Critical Hit plus +1 additional damage for every 5 the result is higher than its Defense.

## Damage Calculation Sidebar

This is a way for both Players and Game Masters to add up their damage in a way that's simple and quick. Once you Hit with an Attack, the GM will tell you if the Attack was a Heavy Hit or higher. This helps you determine how much additional damage your Attack deals (see the process shown below). The GM will apply any applicable Resistances or Vulnerabilities to determine the total amount of damage the target takes (see 'Damage Modifications' on page 36 for more on the target reducing damage).

## Adding Damage Order

Add up the damage totals in the following order:

1. **Base Damage:** Start with the Base Damage of the Attack.
2. **Heavy & Critical Hits:** Add any bonus damage from Critical Hits or Heavy Hits and higher.
3. **Action Points:** Add any bonus damage from Action Points spent (Maneuvers, Class Features, AP Enhancements, etc.).
4. **Situational Bonuses:** Add any bonus damage from situational bonuses (Weapon Passives, Class Features, Magic Items, etc.).

**DC Tip:** Starting with the Base Damage is a great foundation, and getting the Heavy Hit + out of the way first is nice. You'll get better at all the 'by 5's' math over time! Then you add any damage gained by spending AP, then any passives. This creates a great 'checkpoint' system for you to mentally navigate and keep things simple and quick.

**Example:** A Rogue attacks a beast with his Shortsword (we start off with a Base Damage of 1). They get a Brutal Hit and gain +2 bonus damage on their hit (1 + 2 = 3). They target has a condition on it which increases their damage by +1 (1 + 2 + 1 = 4). They also got hit by the target this round and gain the Weapon Passive of the Sword of +1. So now their total damage is 5 (1 Base + 2 Brutal + 1 Cheap Shot + 1 Sword Passive = 5 Total).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Damage Types

There are 13 different damage types in the game, as seen in the list below. Each damage type represents a different method for harming a creature.

**Bludgeoning Damage:** Things that bludgeon you, like a hammer or fist.

**Piercing Damage:** Things that pierce you, like an arrow or fangs.

**Slashing Damage:** Things that slash you, like a blade or claw.

**Fire Damage:** Things that burn you, like fire or other forms of intense heat.

**Cold Damage:** Things that freeze you. like ice or intense cold.

**Lightning Damage:** Things that shock you, like lightning or other forms of electricity.

**Sonic Damage:** Things that assault your hearing, like high volume or concentrated sound.

**Poison Damage:** Things that poison you, like toxins.

**Corrosion Damage:** Things that decay and wither you, like acids and rust effects.

**Psychic Damage:** Things that assault your mind, like psychic attacks.

**Radiant Damage:** Things that singe you, like holy light, lasers, and radiation.

**Umbral Damage:** Things that harm your soul, like dark or eldritch power.

**True Damage:** A special type of damage that can't be reduced by any means.

## Damage Type Categories

Damage types (except True damage) are organized into the following categories: Physical, Elemental, and Mystical.

**Physical Damage:** Includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**Elemental Damage:** Includes Cold, Corrosion, Fire, Lightning, Poison, and Sonic.

**Mystical Damage:** Includes Psychic, Radiant, and Umbral.

## Damage Vulnerability, Resistance, & Immunity

Resistance is a way for creatures to reduce the damage they take, while Vulnerability increases damage taken. The source of what gives them this ability could come from a natural ability they have, a Class Feature, Magic Items, etc. Here are the different ways that these different effects work:

## Damage Resistance

**Resistance (X):** Damage taken of the specified type is reduced by X each time the creature takes damage of that type.

**Example:** If you had Fire Resistance (2) and took 7 Fire damage, you would instead take 5 Fire damage (you subtract 2 from the Fire damage taken, so 7-2 = 5).

**Resistance (Half):** Damage taken of the specified type is halved (minimum of 1 damage reduced).

**Example 1:** If you had Fire Resistance (Half) and took 7 Fire damage, you would instead take 4 Fire damage (half of 7 is 3.5, rounded up is 4).

**Example 2:** If you had Radiant Resistance and took 1 Radiant damage, the damage would be halved to 0.5 and rounded back up to 1 damage taken. However, since Resistance reduces damage by a minimum of 1, the damage would be reduced to 0.

## Damage Immunity

Damage taken of the specified type is reduced to 0.

**Example:** If you had Cold Immunity and were dealt 7 Cold damage, you would take 0 damage instead.

## Damage Vulnerability

**Vulnerability (X):** Increase damage taken by X each time the creature takes damage of that type.

**Example:** If you had Poison Vulnerability (2) and took 3 Poison damage, you would instead take 4 Poison damage (you add 1 to the Poison damage taken, so 3 + 2 = 5).

**Vulnerability (Double):** Increases the Damage taken by 2 times of the specified type.

**Example:** If a Werewolf has Vulnerability (Double) to Silvered Weapons and takes 5 damage from an Attack, they would instead take 10 damage (5 x 2 = 10).

<!-- image -->

## Damage Reduction

Damage Reduction (DR) grants Damage Resistance (Half) against Attacks, except against Critical Hits and Heavy Hits (or higher). There are 3 types of Damage Reduction:

**Physical Damage Reduction:** PDR protects you from the following damage types: Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing.

**Elemental Damage Reduction:** EDR protects you from the following damage types: Cold, Corrosion, Fire, Lightning, Poison, and Sonic.

**Mystical Damage Reduction:** MDR protects you from the following damage types: Radiant, Psychic, and Umbral.

**DC Tip:** There can be specific types of DR for certain Damage Types that special items or monsters have. You could have something that even gives 'Fire Damage Reduction' for example.

**Example:** A creature makes an Attack to hit a target with an PD of 10. The result of their Check is 12, which hits the target and deals 4 Bludgeoning damage. The target has a PDR, which provides Bludgeoning Resistance against this Attack, and halves the damage to 2 (4 / 2 = 2). Alternatively, if the result of the Check was 15, it would be 5 over the target's PD of 10, making it a Heavy Hit. In this scenario, the PDR is bypassed, the damage isn't reduced, and the target takes the full 4 damage plus 1 damage for the Heavy Hit.

## Stacking Damage Vulnerabilities, Resistances, & Immunities

**Example:** If you had Fire Resistance (1) from an Ancestry Trait and Fire Resistance (1) from a Class Feature, these Resistances would be replaced by Fire Resistance (Half) instead. So if you took 4 Fire damage from an Attack, the damage would be reduced by half down to 2 damage (4 / 2 = 2).

## Damage Resistance X & Vulnerability X

A creature that gains Damage Resistance X or Damage Vulnerability X from multiple sources they are all added together.

## Damage Resistance (Half) & Vulnerability (Double)

Multiple sources of Damage Resistance (Half) or Damage Vulnerability (Double) do not stack.

**Example:** If you had Lightning Resistance (Half) from a Class Feature and Elemental Resistance (which includes Lightning Resistance) from the EDR granted by your Armor, you would still only take half damage when you take Lightning damage (not a quarter of the damage, because they don't stack).

## Damage Modifications

Total damage is determined after all damage modifications are taken into account. When a creature takes damage, the total damage taken is determined by following the steps below:

1. **Adding & Subtracting**
- **Damage Resistance X:** its Resist X reduces the damage by the value of X (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Damage Vulnerability X:** its Vulnerable X increases the damage by the value of X (1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. **Doubling & Halving**
- **Damage Resistance (Half):** The damage is halved (rounded up, minimum of 1 damage reduced).
- **Damage Vulnerability (Double):** The damage is doubled (minimum of 1 damage taken).

If a creature has the same type and amount of Resistance and Vulnerability, they cancel each other out (e.g. Fire Resistance (1) & Fire Vulnerability (1), or Cold Resistance (Double) & Cold Vulnerability (Double)).

**DC Tip:** Basically any kind of addition or subtraction of damage happens FIRST, then any multiplication or division of damage AFTER.

**Example 1:** A creature has Cold Resistance (1) from its Ancestry, and Cold Vulnerability (Double) from a Monster Effect. When that creature is Hit by an Attack that deals 5 Cold damage, the damage is reduced by 1 (Cold Resistance (1)) to a total of 3, and then doubled (Cold Vulnerability) to a total of 6.

**Example 2:** A creature has Fire Vulnerability (1) from its Ancestry, and Fire Resistance (Half) from the EDR granted by its Armor. When that creature is Hit by an Attack that deals 5 Fire damage, the damage is increased by 1 (Fire Vulnerability (1)) to a total of 6, and then halved (Fire Resistance (Half) from EDR) to a total of 3.

## Managing Damage Multiples

## Multiple Damage Types

**Resistances:** When you take multiple types of damage that you have Resistances to, you apply your Resistances to each damage type individually.

**Example:** You have Physical Resistance (Half) from PDR granted by Armor and take 3 Piercing damage and 3 Slashing damage from an Attack. The Piercing damage would be reduced by half to 1.5, then rounded up to 2 damage taken. The same would be true of the Slashing damage (2 damage taken). You would take a total of 4 damage from the Attack.

**Bonus Damage:** When dealing bonus damage on an Attack that deals more than 1 type of damage, you choose which of those damage types the bonus damage increases.

**Example:** A Barbarian Hits a target with an Attack using a magical Hammer that deals 2 Bludgeoning damage and 2 Lightning damage. If the Barbarian is Raging at the time, they deal +1 damage from their Rage Feature. The Barbarian can choose to apply their Rage damage to the Bludgeoning or Lightning damage.

## Bonus Damage Against Multiple Targets

If you add bonus damage to an Attack that targets multiple targets, the bonus damage only applies to one target of your choice. The Attack still benefits from Critical Hits, Heavy Hits, and beyond against each target.

## Shared Damage

When 2 or more creatures share damage, divide the damage by the number of creatures (rounding up), and distribute the damage equally among the creatures. If the creatures are sharing damage of multiple types, you calculate the shared damager for each type taken (see example 3)

**Example 1:** A Champion steps in front of an Attack against an ally and they share the damage. If the total damage was 5, then each creature now takes 3 damage (half of 5 is 2.5, rounded up to 3).

**Example 2:** A creature is thrown 10 Spaces into a wall, taking 10 Bludgeoning damage upon impact. However, if 2 creatures were to stand side-by-side in the thrown creature's path, all 3 creatures would share the damage upon impact. The 10 damage would be divided by the 3 creatures, resulting in each creature taking 3.33 Bludgeoning damage. No matter what the fraction is, you always round up in DC20, so now each creature takes 4 damage.

**Example 3:** A Barbarian steps in front of an Attack against an ally and they share the damage. If the total damage was 3 Bludgeoning and 2 Lightning damage, then each creature now takes 2 Bludgeoning (half of 3 is 1.5, rounded up to 2). and 1 Lightning damage.

**DC Tip:** Yes this does mean that sharing damage might result in the group as a whole taking more damage than if they had not shared the damage. This is on purpose and also accounts for everyone smashing into each other and truly sharing the blow.

## Combat Resources

## Action Points

You have Actions Points (AP) which you can spend in Combat. You can spend AP on Actions, Reactions, or Features, such as Maneuvers, Cantrip Enhancements, Class Features, and Ancestry Features. You are considered to be taking an action when you spend Action Points. Your Action Point maximum is 4.

**Gaining AP:** At the start of Combat, each creature gains a number of Actions Points equal to its AP Maximum. Once an Action Point is spent, it can't be used again until it's regained.

**Regaining AP:** You regain all spent Action Points when your turn ends.

**DC Tip:** Remember, you get all of your AP back at the end of your turn, so make sure you spend all of your AP before your turn ends.

## AP Outside of Combat

Action Points can't be spent outside of Combat. Instead, a creature declares what Action it will take and performs that Action. A creature can't take an Action that has an AP cost higher than the creature's AP maximum.

**Longer Actions:** If the AP cost of the Action is greater than 4, the GM might require the creature to spend a more time than normal to complete the Action.

When a PC takes the Help Action outside of Combat, it grants another creature a d8. The PC can't take another Action until the GM says enough time has passed to do so. The GM might wait until all PCs have taken an Action before allowing the PC to use the Help Action (or different Action) again.

**Example:** Your group is getting ready for a big even (heist, performance or even a Combat or Skill Challenge, etc), each party member describes what Skill Check they are about to do. The Bard of the group can't go up to each PC and take multiple Help Actions to grant multiple Help Dice to each of them, they can only do one... unless the Checks being made are separated in time enough and the GM allows the multiple instances of Help (if it made sense).

**DC Tip:** Basically Combat is more strict and structured in both turn order (Initiative) and in how much you can do at a time (4 Action Points per Round of Combat). If you're not in Combat then everything is more fluid and free-form.

## Combat Actions Sidebar

Combat in DC20 is a time when PCs are pushed to their absolute limit; a time when they rise to the occasion, often surprising themselves with what they're capable of doing. The way this is represented mechanically is by allowing players to spend AP in order to apply stacking ADV to significant rolls made during the most dire of situations. This perfectly reflects real life experiences of 'Mother's Strength' to rescue a child from a car or an athlete's propensity for performing best during the real event instead of in practice.

There are many ways to justify why PCs are more capable and reliable within combat: Adrenaline coursing through their system, pressure to succeed as failure isn't an option, or even excitement and other endorphins fueling their performance or putting them in a state of flow. Regardless of which of these you choose to substantiate this change in success rate, there is one more consideration to keep in mind.

DC20 is a game with mechanics and rules designed to facilitate epic stories and fun moments around the table. Some of those mechanics, like having a higher chance of success to pick a lock in combat, come with a significantly higher risk of failure. Failing to pick a lock outside of combat results in wasted time, repeated attempts, and generally just wasting your time until you either succeed, give up, or get past it in some other manner. Failing to pick a lock within combat often comes at the cost of assisting your allies in winning the combat. There are a number of moments when PCs might be expected to make Checks during combat in DC20 to aid in the victory conditions or ease the combat. Those actions are encouraged and facilitated by the '1 AP to grant yourself ADV' rule of combat.

Keep in mind that casting Spells outside of Combat is already accounted for, in that you reduce the cost of Spells outside of Combat (see below). The only time that this benefit isn't felt is at levels 1 and 2, which I feel is fine since we're talking about 'novice' spellcasters. It makes sense to me that these lower level spellcasters aren't able to take advantage of this MP reduction (since they have to spend a minimum of 1 MP).

<!-- image -->

**DC Tip:** To those that find these explanations, both narrative and mechanical, unsatisfactory, I offer the following simple adjustment: any Check made during Combat has its DC increased by 5. This is still the Beta and this concept of the game will continue to be monitored and polished, but I hope this empowers our GMs to run the game smoothly.

## Mana Points

Spellcasting PCs have Mana Points (MP) which can be spent on Spells, Spell Enhancements, Class Features, and Ancestry Traits.

**Gaining Maximum MP:** You can gain MP from the Spellcasting Mastery Feature granted by Spellcasting Classes (Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard, etc.), from Talents (such as the Multiclassing Talents), or from Ancestry Features.

**Regaining MP:** You regain all MP when you finish a Long Rest.

## MP Outside of Combat

When you spend MP outside of Combat, the cost is reduced by 1 (minimum of 1). The total MP cost before this reduction can't be greater than your Mana Spend Limit.

**DC Tip:** If you were to run 1 mile to a neighbor's house, there's not much stress there... but if you were to run 1 mile away from a tiger that was chasing you... that's FAR more difficult and exhausting. This concept holds true for Spellcasting too.

## Stamina Points

Martial PCs have Stamina Points (SP) which can be spent on Techniques and Class Features, and are also used in place of Action Points when performing Martial Maneuvers.

**Gaining Maximum SP:** You can gain SP from the Martial Mastery Feature granted by Martial Classes (Barbarian, Champion, Rogue, etc.), from Talents (such as the Multiclassing Talents), or from Ancestry Features.

**Regaining SP:** You can regain SP during Combat in a variety of ways based on your Class's Stamina Regen. You regain all spent SP when Combat ends.

**Example:** The Champion Class regains SP by performing Maneuvers, the Barbarian regains SP by taking or scoring Heavy, Brutal, and Critical Hits, and the Rogue regains SP by hitting a creature that's affected by Conditions.

**Action Points to Stamina:** On your turn, you can spend 2 AP to regain 1 SP.

**Mana to Stamina:** Once on each of your turns, you can spend 1 or more MP to regain 1 SP per MP spent.

## SP Outside of Combat

You can perform any Action outside of Combat that uses Stamina without spending any SP, however the SP cost can't be higher than your SP maximum.

**DC Tip:** Stamina Points should only be tracked when you're in a high stress situation like Combat (or even some Skill Challenges). If time isn't being tracked (such as during Skill Challenges) then there's no need to keep track of SP. PCs can use and spend SP freely outside of these times and essentially are able to perform anything that uses SP at no cost, since they get the SP back instantly outside of Combat.

## Stamina & Mana Sidebar

This isn't game breaking because Stamina Points aren't like Mana Points. Features that use Stamina don't provide magical benefits, they provide physical benefits such as being able to jump farther, shove things, or smash things. These things usually don't provide many advantages outside of combat. It's also intended that if a PC can spend SP to jump farther, then they should be able to use that outside of Combat to jump farther for free.

## Grit Points

Characters with a high Charisma Attribute have a strong force of will. Grit Points represent a Character being able to push through and go beyond their limits in difficult situations.

## Grit Points

You gain a number of Git Points equal to 2 + your Charisma. If your Charisma is negative, then your total Grit Points is reduced by the same amount.

**Regaining Grit Points:** You regain all spent Grit Points when you complete a Long Rest.

## Spending Grit Points

**Bearing Damage:** When you're Hit by an Attack, you can spend 1 or more Grit Points to reduce the damage you take by 1 per Grit Point spent.

**Save Resolve:** When you make a Save, you can spend Grit Points to grant yourself ADV on the Save. You must do so before you roll any dice as part of making the Save.

<!-- image -->

## Actions

Anything that you spend Action Points on is considered an Action.

## Taking an Action

A creature can take an Action on its turn by spending Action Points (AP). The AP cost of taking an Action is listed in the Action's description.

## Minor Action

Once per turn, you can perform up to 2 of the following tasks without spending AP. You can't take Actions (such as the Attack Action) between these 2 tasks.

- Open or Close a Door.
- Grab or Release an Item.
- Retrieve or Stow an Item.
- Draw or Sheathe a Weapon.

**Additional Minor Actions:** You can spend 1 AP to perform a Minor Action again during the same turn.

## Types of Actions

A creature can take the following Actions on its turn: Attack, Move, Disengage, Dodge, Grapple, Help, Hide, Object, Shove, and Spell Action.

## Offensive Actions

## Attack

You can spend 1 AP to make 1 Attack Check.

## Disarm

You can spend 1 AP to make an Attack Check contested by the target's Athletics, Acrobatics, or Trickery Check (target's choice), the target has ADV if they're holding the object with 2 hands, you have DisADV if the target is larger than you. You can't Disarm a creature that's 2 Sizes larger than you. **Success:** The targeted object falls into an unoccupied space of your choice within 1 Space of the creature.

<!-- image -->

## Grapple

Using a free hand, you can spend 1 AP to attempt to Grapple another creature within 1 Space. Make an Athletics Check contested by the opposing creature's Martial Check. You or the target may have ADV or DisADV on your Check based on each other's size (see 'Moving & Grappling Creatures' on page 71). **Success:** The creature is Grappled by you.

**Dragging:** You can move the target to any Space adjacent to you by spending your own Movement to do so. Alternatively, when you move, you can move the target with you, but you're considered Slowed (Every 1 Space you move costs an extra 1 Space of movement).

## Ending a Grapple

**Escape Grapple:** The target can spend 1 AP to attempt to free itself from a Grapple. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target's Martial Check. **Failure:** The Grapple immediately ends.

**Incapacitated Grappler:** If you become Incapacitated, the Grapple immediately ends.

**Forced Movement:** If an effect attempts to forcibly move the target beyond your reach, you make the Check or Save instead of the target. If the effect targets both you and the target, you make 1 Check or Save for both of you. **Success:** The targets of the effect are not moved. **Failure:** The Grapple immediately ends, and the targets of the effect are moved.

**Falling:** If the target begins falling (and you don't), the Grapple ends if you can't carry the target's weight. If you can carry its weight, you hold it suspended in the air.

## Shove

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to push a creature within 1 Space of you. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target's Martial Check. **Success:** You push the creature 1 Space away from you or to its left or right. **Success (each 5):** Push up to 1 additional Space.

**Knock Prone:** After the result, you can choose to reduce the total distance the target is pushed by 1 Space to knock them Prone instead.

## Tackle

If you move at least 2 Spaces in a straight line, you can spend 1 AP to attempt to Tackle a creature that's your Size or smaller. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target's Martial Check. **Success:** You Grapple the target and you both move 1 Space in the same direction you're moving then immediately fall Prone. **Success (each 5):** +1 Space moved.

<!-- image -->

## Defensive Actions

## Disengage

You can spend 1 AP to impose DisADV on Opportunity Attacks made against you until the start of your next turn.

**Full Disengage:** When you take the Disengage Action, you can spend an additional 1 AP to become Immune to Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.

## Dodge

You can spend 1 AP to impose DisADV on the next Attack or Grapple made against you before the start of your next turn.

**Full Dodge:** When you take the Dodge Action, you can spend an additional 1 AP to impose DisADV on all Attacks or Grapples made against you until the start of your next turn.

## Hide

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to Hide from 1 or more creatures that can't see you (Unseen). Make a Stealth Check against any opposing creatures' Passive Awareness. **Success:** You become Hidden from creatures whose Passive Awareness you beat (making you Unseen and Unheard by them). You remain Hidden until you make a noise louder than a whisper, make an Attack, cast a Spell with a Verbal Component, or a creature takes the Search Action and successfully locates you.

See 'Hidden Creatures' on page 74 for more on hiding.

**DC Tip:** When you take the Hide Action and beat an enemy's Passive Awareness, you only become Hidden from that creature because it can't see or hear you (you are both Unseen and Unheard). However, if your Stealth Check beats one enemy's Awareness Score but not another's, then you are Hidden from the first enemy, but you're not Hidden from the second enemy.

## Utility Actions

## Move

You can spend 1 AP to move up to your Speed in Spaces (default of 5). You choose where to move, and can break up your movement by moving before and after taking a different Action. You can't end your turn in a Space occupied by another creature.

**Example:** A creature with 4 AP can take the Move Action to move 1 Space, take the Attack Action, move 1 Space again (2 total Spaces), take the Attack Action again, and then move 2 Spaces again (4 total Spaces).

## Help

You can spend 1 AP to grant another creature a d8 Help Die that lasts until the start of your next turn. Upon granting the Help Die, you must declare which creature you're Helping and the type of Check you'll be aiding them with, while meeting the following conditions:

**Attack:** You declare 1 target for the Attack. You must be within 1 Space of the Attacker or the target of the Attack. While the Help Die lasts, it can be added to an Attack made against the target.

**Skill or Trade Check:** You declare a type of Skill or Trade Check. You describe how you're Helping them and must do so with a Skill or Trade that you have at least 1 Mastery Level in. You can use the same Skill or Trade or a different one.

The Help Die can only be used to aid the type of Check declared and disappears once it's used.

**Multiple Help Penalty:** Once you take the Help Action, each time you take the Help Action again before the end of your turn, your Help Die decay by 1 step, to a minimum of a d4 (d8 > d6 > d4). These Help Dice only decay when using the Help Action. Help Die granted by other sources decay independently of any Help Dice grant through the Help Action.

**Example:** A Barbarian is about to wrestle an alligator and will need to make an Athletics Checks. A Hunter with Mastery in the Animal Skill can grant the Barbarian a Help Die to add to their Athletics Check made to wrestle the alligator.

**DC Tip:** When taking the Help Action, the GM may allow the PC to contribute to a Skill or Trade Check by using something other than their own Skill or Trade Mastery. If the PC is a Wizard, they may try to use a Spell to contribute to another creature's Skill or Trade Check, but only if the GM decides that it makes sense to do so.

## Object

You can spend 1 AP to perform 1 of the following object interactions:

- Drink a Potion or Administer a Potion to another Creature.
- Attempt to Lock or Unlock a Lock.
- Make a Trickery Check to activate or disable a trap or other mechanism.
- Transfer an Item to or from another Creature (only 1 of the two creatures spends 1 AP).
- Throw an Item to location you can see up to 5 Spaces away.

## Spell

You can spend 1 or more AP to cast a Spell that you know. If the Spell has a Mana Point requirement, you must spend that much MP to cast the Spell.

<!-- image -->

## Skill Based Actions

A creature can take the following Skill Actions on its turn: Analyze Creature, Calm Animal, Combat Insight, Conceal, Feint, Intimidate, Investigate, Jump, Medicine, Mounted Defense, Pass Through, or Search.

## Analyze Creature

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to recall or discern some information about a creature that you can see or hear. Make a DC 10 Knowledge Check.

**Success:** You learn a piece of lore about the creature. **Success (each 5):** You learn 1 creature statistic (PD, AD, Attacks, Abilities, Resistances, Vulnerabilities, Immunities, etc.)

**DC Tip:** There are 5 types of Knowledge Checks related to creature types: Arcana (Constructs, Monstrosities, and Oozes), History (Dragons, Giants, and Humanoids), Nature (Beasts, Elementals, Fey, and Plants), Occultism (Aberrations, Fiends, and Undead), and Religion (Celestials). If a PC has a custom Knowledge Trade they think might help in the situation, they can ask the GM to use that Knowledge Trade instead.

## Calm Animal

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to beguile a Beast that can see or hear you. Make an Animal Check contested by the target's Repeated Charisma Save.

**Success:** The animal is Taunted by you for 1 minute or until you target it with a harmful Attack, Spell, or other effect. **Success (5):** It's instead Intimidated. **Success (10):** It's also Charmed.

## Combat Insight

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to discern the course of actions a creature might take on its next turn. Make an Insight Check contested by the target's Trickery or Influence Check (its choice).

**Success:** You learn the target's emotional state and whether it plans to make an Attack, cast a Spell, or flee combat during its next turn. **Success (5):** You know who the creature is likely to target with a harmful ability. **Success (10):** You know which ability the creature plans to use.

**DC Tip:** If the target is a PC, its player tells you what the creature plans to do. If the target is an NPC, the GM tells you what the creature plans to do.

## Conceal

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to hide an object on yourself or in nearby foliage, debris, or decor to render it Hidden. Make a contested Trickery Check against the Passive Awareness of creatures that can see you.

**Success:** The object is Hidden from any creature whose Passive Awareness you beat.

<!-- image -->

## Feint

You can spend 1 AP to make a Trickery Check contested by the Insight Check of a creature that can see you within 3 Spaces.

**Success:** The next Attack against the target before the start of your next turn has ADV and deals +1 damage.

## Intimidate

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to intimidate a creature that can see or hear you. Make an Intimidation Check contested by the target's Charisma Save.

**Success:** The target is Intimidated by you until the end of your next turn.

## Investigate

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to uncover a concealed object on a creature, a secret compartment, or the intended function of a mechanism within 1 Space of you.

**Concealed Objects:** You can attempt to uncover any objects concealed on a creature. Make an Investigation Check contested by the target's Trickery Check.

**Success:** You know the location of any concealed object on the creature.

**Secret Compartments:** You can attempt to uncover any secret comportments. Make an Investigation Check against the discovery DC of any secret compartments.

**Success:** You discover the location of any secret compartments whose discovery DC you beat.

**Discern Mechanism:** You can attempt to discern the functionality of a mechanism (the effect of a trap, how to open a secret door, or activate a device). Make an Investigation Check.

**Success:** You learn how the mechanism works and the methods to activate and disable it (if any).

## Jump

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to increase the distance you can cover when Jumping (see 'Jumping' on page 66). Make a DC 10 Martial Check.

**Long Jump:** **Success:** You can move 1 additional Space as part of your Long Jump. **Success (each 5):** +1 additional Space.

**High Jump:** **Success:** You can move an additional 1ft (30cm) as part of your High Jump. **Success (each 5):** +1ft (30cm).

## Medicine

You can spend 1 AP to touch a creature and tend to its wounds. Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. **Success:** You end 1 stack of Bleeding on the target. **Success (each 5):** You end 1 additional stack of Bleeding on the target.

<!-- image -->

## Mounted Defense

You can spend 1 AP to maneuver a mount you're riding to avoid danger. Make a DC 10 Animal Check.

**Success:** The mount's PD increases by 2 until the start of your next turn. **Success (5):** +2 PD. **Success (10):** +4 PD.

## Pass Through

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to move through a Space occupied by a hostile creature that's within 1 size of you. Make a contested Martial Check against the target. **Success:** You can move through the creature's Space as if it were Difficult Terrain (Slowed while moving through the area). **Success (5):** You can move through the creature's space without it counting as Difficult Terrain.

## Search

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to locate 1 or more Hidden creatures and concealed objects within your Line of Sight.

**Hidden Creatures:** You attempt to locate any Hidden creatures in the area. Make an Awareness Check against the Stealth Check of any Hidden creatures. **Success:** You know the location of any Hidden creature whose Stealth Check you beat until the end of your turn. Knowing a creature's location doesn't grant you the ability to see it.

**Hidden Objects:** You attempt to locate any Hidden objects in the area. Make an Awareness Check against the DC to discover any concealed objects (such as traps, secret doors, or hidden items). **Success:** You discover the location of any Hidden object whose discovery DC you beat.

**DC Tip:** Without obstruction, a PC's line of sight could reach the horizon. You might ask your PC to make their Awareness Check with Disadvantage to detect a creature that's far away, such as beyond 10 Spaces.

<!-- image -->

## Advanced Actions

## Held Actions

Sometimes the circumstances aren't exactly right for the action you want to take. When that happens, you can choose to wait until just the right moment by Holding your Action. To Hold your Action, you must declare an Action you want to take and state a Trigger. Once you do so, you can't change the Action or Trigger.

**Declare Action:** When you declare the Action, you must immediately spend the Action Points required to take that Action. The Multiple Check Penalty from this turn applies to any Checks you make as part of this Reaction.

**State Trigger:** The Trigger must be an observable event, such as 'I want to wait until an enemy moves into range to make an Attack against them', 'I want to wait until I see my ally get out of range before I shoot the barrel filled with explosives', or something else.

**Take Reaction:** If the stated Trigger occurs at any time before the start of your next turn, you can take the declared Action as a Reaction. If the Reaction requires you to spend any additional resources (such as Stamina Points or Mana Points) you spend them now. Your Reaction interrupts the events stated in the Trigger, allowing you to act before the events resolve. If the Trigger never occurs, then the declared Action can't be taken and the AP spent is wasted.

**Example:** It's your turn and you have 2 AP remaining to spend, but you really want to work together with an ally. You tell the GM that you want to spend 2 AP on Held Actions. You declare that you will be taking the Move Action and the Attack Action and you spend 2 AP right now. You also state the Trigger for these Held Actions is 'your ally is in melee range of an enemy'. Once the Trigger occurs you take those 2 Actions immediately. You take a Move Action to move to the creatures and then you make an Attack Action on a creature. If the creatures are too far away for 1 Move Action (1 AP), then you would only be able to move as far as you can and the Attack Action (1 AP) is wasted since you were not close enough to make an Attack. You can't convert the 1 AP spent on the Attack Action into another Move Action, since that's not what you declared.

**DC Tip:** PCs can set triggers to be something less specific like, 'I'm going to shoot an arrow at the next enemy I see.' Just make sure the PC and the GM are on the same page on what the intent of what they're wanting to do is for their Reactions Trigger.

<!-- image -->

## Reactions

Reactions are Actions that a creature can take during another creature's turn. A creature can't take a Reaction on their own turn, unless the Reaction allows them to do so in response to another creature's Reaction. Reactions are not affected by the Multiple Check Penalty.

## Taking a Reaction

A creature can take a Reaction on another creature's turn provided it meets the requirements to do so. The requirements to take a Reaction are listed in the Reaction's Prerequisite and Trigger statements. You can only take 1 Reaction per Trigger.

**Example 1:** When a creature leaves a Martial PC's reach, they would only be able to make 1 Opportunity Attack against the creature (they could still spend AP to perform Attack Maneuvers with their Opportunity Attack).

**Example 2:** When an Attack is made within 1 Space of a Martial PC, the PC could take the Parry Maneuver against the Attack (1st trigger). If the Attack still Hits (2nd trigger), the PC could take the Protection Maneuver to share the damage with the target.

## Reaction Requirements

**Prerequisite:** A prerequisite states the Feature (Martial Feature, Spellcasting Feature, or a different Feature) required to gain access to the Reaction.

**Trigger:** A trigger states the conditions that must be met in order for a creature to take the Reaction.

## Spending Resources

If a Reaction has a resource cost (Action Points, Mana Points, Stamina Points, etc.), a creature must spend those resources to take the Reaction.

**Regaining Resources:** Reactions give a creature an opportunity to spend Action Points during another creature's turn. If a creature spends Action Points, they'll have less Action Points to spend on their next turn. Any spent Action Points are not regained until the end of a creature's turn.

**Example:** If you take a Reaction to spend 1 Action Point, on your next turn you will only have 3 Action Points to use (4 -1 = 3).

**DC Tip:** If you somehow manage to spend all 4 of your AP before your turn, then you would have 0 AP at the start of your next turn. You wouldn't be able to do anything, so your turn would immediately end and you'd get your 4 AP back.

**Multiple Reactions:** A creature can spend Action Points to take multiple Reactions provided they meet all the conditions and can spend enough resources to do so.

## Types of Reactions

## Opportunity Attack

**Prerequisite:** Martial Mastery

**Trigger:** A creature you can see within your Melee Range uses its movement to leave your Melee Range, draws a Weapon, picks an item up off the ground, or takes the Object Action.

**Reaction:** You can spend 1 AP to make a Melee Martial Attack against the provoking creature.

**DC Tip:** You can spend additional AP to gain ADV or to perform Maneuvers with the Attack.

## Spell Duel

**Prerequisite:** Spellcasting Mastery

**Trigger:** Another creature you can see casts a Spell

**DC Tip:** Remember that MP Effects (such as a Bard's Bardic Performance Feature) count as Spells for the purposes of Spell Duels and Combo Spellcasting.

**Reaction:** You declare a Spell Duel and spend 2 AP and 1 or more MP to challenge the creature with a Spell of your own. You can declare a Spell Duel after the creature makes its Spell Check but before you know the result of its Check.

**DC Tip:** Once a Spell Duel is declared, the opponent can't change their declared Spell or modify their Spell Check in any way.

**Multiple Participants:** Additional creatures can choose to participate in helping the Spell take effect or participate in stopping the Spell from taking effect. If multiple creatures choose to participate in the Spell Duel, the participants are sorted into Initiators (those trying to help the Spell take effect) and Challengers (those trying to prevent the Spell from taking effect). During the Contest (see further below) every participant makes their Spell Check, and the highest Initiator result is compared against the highest Challenger result to determine the outcome.

## Choosing a Spell

You declare which Spell you are using to challenge the opposing Spell and then describe how you do so using your Spell. The GM decides if that makes sense.

**DC Tip:** You are not actually casting this Spell as stated in its description, you are instead using the 'flavor' of the Spell to be how you initiate the Spell Duel. The only part of the Spell's mechanics that matter is its Range and/ or Area of Effect.

**Targeted:** If your chosen Spell targets 1 or more creatures or objects, you must be able to target the opposing creature or any of its targets with your Spell.

**Area of Effect:** If your chosen Spell covers an area (such as an Arc, Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere), then your Spell's Area of Effect must include the opposing creature, any of its targets, or cover an area between the opposing creature and any of its targets.

**Success & Failure:** The success and failure statements of your Spell are replaced by the success and failure statements in the Contest section below.

## Contest

The Spell Check the opposing creature makes to cast its Spell is Contested by the Spell Check you make to cast your Spell. When comparing the Spell Checks for the purpose of determining the winner of the Contest, each creature gains a bonus to its Check equal to the MP it spent on its Spell.

**Success:** The target creature's Spell fails and has no effect.

**Failure:** The target creature's Spell succeeds and takes effect.

**Tie:** The target creature's Spell fails, has no effect, and you each roll on the Wild Magic Table. The effect from the table lasts until the end of your next turn.

Whatever the result, each creature still spends all AP, MP, or other resources they spent to cast their Spell.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

**Spell Duel Walkthrough Example:** An Enemy says they are casting Scorching Ray at one of your allies. You shout out, 'Spell Duel!' You choose your Cone of Cold Spell and are in range of an area between the enemy and your ally. You describe ice blasting out of your hands to try and intercept the fiery projectiles. You then spend 2 AP and choose to spend 3 MP for the Spell Duel. The enemy caster Makes their Spell Check in the same way that they would if you had done nothing. You also make your Spell Check and then both you and the enemy caster get a bonus to your roll equal to the MP spent. You compare your results together and see what happens as both of your magics collide midair.

**DC Tip:** Get creative with your Spells and think of cool descriptions. See the examples below for increasingly creative ways to use your Spells… BUT it's always at the GM's discretion. Some of these examples might not be allowed by your GM. The examples below show different ways that the 'range requirement' can be met, being in range of either the caster, their targets, or a space between the two.

**Creative Example 1:** Enemy casts a Lightning Bolt at an ally. You choose your Wall of Earth Spell and are in range of an area between the enemy and your ally. You describe rocks forming a wall between them and your ally attempting to block the lightning.

**Creative Example 2:** Enemy casts Poison Cloud at an area. You choose your Gust Spell and are in range of at least one ally inside of the effected area. You describe a rush of wind shooting out from you to blow away the noxious cloud.

**Creative Example 3:** Enemy casts Disintegrate at an ally. You choose your Dissonant Whispers Spell and are in range of the enemy caster. You describe entering their mind to attempt to give them a hallucination that they already cast the spell.

**Creative Example 4:** Enemy casts Fireball at an area. You choose your Calm Emotions Spell and are in range of the enemy caster. You describe attempting to changing their emotions to be chill and relaxed... they don't want to hurt anyone anymore. Your GM says that makes no sense and you now have to pick some other Spell or the enemy's Spell goes off as intended.

## Wild Magic Table

## D20 Wild Surge Outcome

- **1** You turn into a small creature with the stats of a Sheep (HP 2, PD & AD 5, Melee Attack +2, Damage 1).

## Maneuvers

Maneuvers are Martial abilities to perform feats of strength and agility on the battlefield. You gain access to these through gaining a Martial Mastery Feature from being a Martial Class or certain Subclasses. If a Spellcaster Class spends a Talent to get a Martial Class Feature they also gain access to Maneuvers through the Multiclass Martial Path (see 'Multiclass Talents' on page 100).

You can spend AP to perform one or multiple Maneuvers, which allow PCs with Martial Mastery to enhance their offensive and defensive abilities in combat. You can use the same Maneuver multiple times, unless it's stated otherwise. There are several types of Maneuvers: Attack, Save, Grapple, and Defense.

**Attack:** Attack Maneuvers modify your Martial Attacks with additional damage, range, or targets.

**Save:** Save Maneuvers modify your Martial Attacks with additional effects that impose debilitating Conditions.

**Grapple:** Grapple Maneuvers modify your Grapple Checks with additional slams, pins, throws, and other effects.

**Defense:** Defense Maneuvers enable you to avoid or mitigate taking damage by blocking, deflecting, or dodging Attacks.

## Multiple Maneuvers

You can't perform the same Maneuver more than once per Attack or Trigger, unless otherwise stated.

## Maneuver Damage

If a Maneuver deals damage, it deals the same type of damage as the Weapon or Unarmed Strike you're using to perform the Maneuver, unless stated otherwise.

## Save Effects

Some Maneuvers force the target to make a Save against your Save DC or suffer a chosen effect. If you force a creature to Save against the effects of multiple Maneuvers that are a part of the same Attack, the target only makes 1 Save against all Physical Save effects.

## Contest Effects

Some Maneuver force a Contest between you and the target creature. If you initiate a Contest with a creature against the effects of multiple Maneuvers, you and the target participate in 1 Contest for all effects.

## Spending Stamina

You can spend SP in place of Action Points when performing a Martial Maneuver.

**Example:** If you wanted to add +1 damage to an Attack (a Power Attack Maneuver), instead of spending 1 AP you could spend 1 SP. You can do this for any Martial Maneuver.

## Attack Maneuvers

When you make a Martial Attack, you can spend additional AP to perform an Attack Maneuver as part of the Attack. You must choose to do so before you make the Attack Check.

**Example:** You spend 4 AP on a Martial Attack against an enemy creature. 1 AP to take the Attack Action (make 1 Attack Check), 1 AP to use Power Attack for +1 damage, 1 AP to use Extend Attack (increase Melee Range by 1), and 1 AP to use Sweep Attack to target a second creature next to the first (only takes 1 damage on a Hit).

**DC Tip:** Don't forget anyone can spend an additional 1 AP to gain ADV on their Attack Check.

## Extend Attack

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) Your Melee Attack Range is increased by 1 Space (or your Ranged Attack Range is increased by 5 Spaces) for the Attack.

## Power Attack

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) You deal +1 damage with the Attack. You can use this Maneuver multiple times.

## Sweep Attack

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) Choose 1 additional target within 1 Space of the original target that's within your Attack Range. Make 1 Attack Check against all targets. **Attack Hit:** The original target takes your Attack's damage, and each additional target Hit takes 1 damage of the same type. You can use this Maneuver multiple times.

<!-- image -->

## Save Maneuvers

When you make a Martial Attack, you can spend additional AP to perform a Save Maneuver with the Attack. When you do, the target makes a Physical Save against your Save DC. **Save Failure:** The target suffers the effects of your Maneuver.

**Example:** You spend 3 AP on an Attack Check against an enemy creature. 1 AP to take the Attack Action (make 1 Attack Check), 1 AP to use Trip (knock Prone), and 1 AP to use Knockback (pushed 1 Space away, possibly more).

## Bleed

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target begins Bleeding (1 True damage at the start of their turn).

## Daze

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target becomes Dazed (DisADV on Mental Checks) on the next Mental Check it makes before the end of your next turn.

## Expose

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target becomes Exposed (Attacks against it have ADV) against the next Attack made against it before the end of your next turn.

## Hamstring

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target becomes Slowed (every 1 Space you move costs an extra 1 Space of movement) until the end of your next turn.

## Hinder

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target becomes Hindered (DisADV on Attacks) on the next Attack it makes before the end of your next turn.

## Impair

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target becomes Impaired (DisADV on Physical Checks) on the next Physical Check it makes before the end of your next turn.

## Knockback

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target is pushed 1 Space away + up to 1 additional Space for every 5 it fails its Save by.

## Trip

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target falls Prone.

<!-- image -->

## Grapple Maneuvers

When you attempt to Grapple a creature, you can spend additional AP to perform a Grapple Maneuver as part of the Grapple attempt. You must choose to do so before you make the Grapple Check. **Grapple Success:** The target is Grappled and suffers the damage or effects of your Maneuver.

You can also perform Grapple Maneuvers on creatures you have Grappled. When you perform a Grapple Maneuver against a creature you have Grappled, you make an Athletics Check Contested by the target's Martial Check. **Contest Success:** The target suffers the damage or effects of your maneuver. **Contest Failure:** The target suffers no additional effects but remains Grappled by you.

## Body Block

**Trigger:** You are targeted by an Attack.

**Reaction (Maneuver):** (1 AP) You reposition a creature Grappled by you to shield yourself from damage. You and the Grappled creature take half the damage dealt by the attack and you can move the Grappled creature to any space adjacent to you immediately afterwards.

## Restrain

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target is Restrained until the Grapple ends. On its turn it can spend 1 AP to end being Restrained, but it remains Grappled until the Condition ends.

**DC Tip:** Restrained makes the target Exposed (ADV on Attacks against them) and Hindered (Target has DisADV on their Attacks).

## Slam

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target takes 1 Bludgeoning damage. **Success (each 5):** +1 damage.

## Takedown

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target falls Prone. You don't fall Prone unless you choose to do so.

## Throw

**Requires:** The Grappled creature is your Size or smaller. **Maneuver:** (1 AP) The target is thrown up to a number of Spaces away from you equal to 1/2 of your Might (ending the Grappled Condition) + up to 1 additional Space for every 5 they fail the Contest by (see 'Throwing Creatures' on page 72 for more information).

**DC Tip:** Using the Throw Maneuver, you can throw a creature as part of the same Grapple Check made to Grapple the them, and you can spend 1 SP instead of 1 AP to do so.

<!-- image -->

## Defense Maneuvers

The Defense Maneuvers are taken to protect your allies or in Reaction to a trigger (an Attack Check, Spell Check, or Contest).

**Reaction Maneuvers:** Some Maneuvers allow you to use a Reaction when a creature is targeted by an Attack (such as Parry, Raise Shield, and Side Step). For such Maneuvers, you can wait until after the Check is made, but you must decide to use the Maneuver before the GM says the result of the Check.

## Parry

**Trigger:** When a creature you can see within 1 Space (including yourself) is targeted by an Attack against its PD.

**Reaction (Maneuver):** (1 AP) You grant the target a +5 bonus to PD against this Attack.

## Protect

**Trigger:** A creature you can see within 1 Space is Hit by an Attack.

**Reaction (Maneuver):** (1 AP) The target takes half of the damage and you take the other half. The damage you take bypasses any Damage Reduction.

## Raise Shield

**Requires:** You're wielding a Shield.

**Trigger:** When a creature you can see within 1 Space (including yourself) is targeted by an Attack against its AD.

**Reaction (Maneuver):** (1 AP) You grant the target a +5 bonus to AD against this Attack.

## Side Step

**Trigger:** You're targeted by an Attack against your PD.

**Reaction (Maneuver):** (1 AP) You move 1 Space to a Space that's still within the Attack's range. When you do, the Attack has DisADV against you. If you move behind Cover, you don't gain the benefit of that Cover against the Attack.

## Swap

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) You switch Spaces with a willing creature within 1 Space. If this movement would provoke an Opportunity Attack against you or the target creature, any Opportunity Attacks are made against you.

## Taunt

**Maneuver:** (1 AP) Choose an enemy creature that can see or hear you within 5 Spaces. Make an Attack Check, Influence Check, or Intimidation Check (your choice) contested by the target's Mental Save. **Contest Success:** The target is Taunted (DisADV on Attacks against creatures other than you) by you on their next Attack.

**Full Taunt:** You can spend an additional 1 AP to have the Taunted Condition last until the end of your next turn.

## Techniques

## Learning Techniques

Martial Classes learn new Techniques at certain levels from the Techniques Known column in their Class Table.

## Techniques List

**BETA RULE:** There is only 1 Technique List (for now) that ALL Martial and Hybrid Classes have access to. There's potential to change this to be Class specific lists, grouped lists (like how Spell Lists work), etc. or it might just stay the same.

## Technique Attack Checks

**Maneuvers:** When you make an Attack Check as part of a Technique, you can spend additional AP to perform Attack or Save Maneuvers as part of that Attack Check. When you do, the Maneuvers only apply to 1 target of the Attack.

**Weapon Style:** When you make an Attack with a Weapon that Hits multiple creatures, the Weapon Style benefit applies to each target individually.

**Example:** If you make an Attack with a Sword against 3 creatures using the Whirlwind Technique, each Exposed creature takes +1 damage from the Attack because of the Sword Weapon Style bonus damage. If 2 of the 3 targets are Exposed, then the 2 Exposed creatures take 1 more damage than the creature that's not Exposed.

<!-- image -->

## Technique Enhancements

Technique Enhancements allow a Martial character to increase the potency of their Techniques by spending additional SP on the Technique. Technique Enhancements are specific to each Technique and are included in a Technique's description. Many Technique Enhancements increase a Technique's damage (if applicable), its duration, its range, its number of targets, or its Area of Effect (if applicable).

**Performing a Technique Enhancement:** When you perform a Technique, you can spend additional SP to perform a Technique Enhancement as part of the Technique. If the Technique requires an Attack Check, you must choose to do so before you make the Check. You can perform the same Technique Enhancement only once per Technique, unless it's stated otherwise.

**DC Tip:** Remember that you can use AP to perform a Maneuver to add to the Attack Check of the Technique as well.

## Techniques

## Forbearance

When a creature you can see within 1 Space is targeted by an Attack, you can spend 1 AP and 1 SP as a Reaction to become the new target of the Check, and choose to switch places with the original target (if it's willing). If the Check is accompanied by a Save (as with a 'Dynamic Attack Saves' on page 27), you make the Save instead of the original target.

## Technique Enhancements

**Steadfast Forbearance:** If multiple creatures within 1 Space of you (after switching places if you choose to do so) are targeted by the same Check, you can attempt to protect them as well. You can spend 1 SP per additional target to become the new target of its Check as well. You take the collective damage of all protected creatures against the Check.

**Immense Defense:** You can spend 2 SP to gain Resistance (Half) against all damage taken using this Technique.

<!-- image -->

## Heroic Bash

Using a Melee Weapon (or Unarmed Strike) you can spend 1 AP and 1 SP to attempt to send an enemy hurling through the air. Make an Attack Check against the PD of a target within 1 Space of you, and it makes a Physical Save against your Save DC. **Attack Hit:** It takes your Weapons(or Unarmed Strike) damage. **Save Failure:** It gets knockback horizontally up to 3 Spaces + 1 additional Space for every 5 it fails the Save by.

**Airborne:** You can choose to knock the enemy vertically into the air. When you do, they move half the total distance and may be subjected to fall damage.

**Knock Prone:** After the result, you can choose to reduce the total distance the target is pushed by 1 Space to knock them Prone instead.

## Technique Enhancements

**Extended Knockback:** You can spend 1 SP to increase the Knockback distance by 2 Spaces and increase the damage by 1.

**Painful Knockback:** You can spend 1 SP to increase the damage by 2.

**Bash & Smash:** You can spend an additional 1 AP and 1 SP to change the Target from one creature to every creature's PD within 1 Space.

You gain up to your Speed in Spaces and increase your Jump Distance by 1 on the next Long or Vertical Jump you make. You leap into the air and make an Attack Check against the PD of a target within 1 Space of where you land, and it makes a Physical Save against your Save DC. **Attack Hit:** It takes your Weapon (or Unarmed Strike) damage. **Save Failure:** The target falls Prone.

## Technique Enhancements

**Brutal Leap:** You can spend 1 SP to transfer all of the Falling damage you would usually take into the target instead (see 'Falling Attacks' on page 72 for more).

**Far Leap:** You can spend 1 SP to increase your damage by 1 and your Jump Distance by 2.

**Heroic Slam:** You can spend 1 AP and 1 SP to compare your Attack Check against the AD of all creatures within 1 Space of where you land (instead of a single target).

## Sunder Armor

You can spend 1 AP and 1 SP to make a Martial Attack against a creature's PD. **Hit:** Until the start of your next turn, the target gains Vulnerability (1) to a damage type dealt by the Attack.

## Tumble and Dive

<!-- image -->

## Spellcasting

In order to cast a Spell, you must know the Spell and spend the required amount of Resources (Action Points and Mana Points). The maximum number of Mana Points you can spend on a single Spell must be equal to or lower than your Mana Spend Limit (see below).

## Spells Known

Spellcaster Classes know a number of Spells as shown in the Spells Known column of their Class Tables. The number of Spells they know increases with level to reflect their growing knowledge of magic as they gain experience. When a PC learns a new Spell, the Spell must be included in their Spell List and possess any required Spell Tags. If a PC has access to multiple Spellcasting Features, they can learn new Spells by following the rules of either Feature.

**Example:** A Wizard can learn any Spell from the Arcane Spell List, however Sorcerers get to choose 1 of the 3 Spell Lists to learn their Spells from. Alternatively, Warlocks can learn any Spell from any Spell List, but are restricted by only being able to choose from 4 Spell Schools.

Spellcasters increase their Spells Known as they gain levels or through certain Class Features, Subclass Features, Talents, or Ancestry Traits.

## Spell Lists

There are 3 Spell Lists: **Arcane**, **Divine**, and **Primal**. A Spell List represents the domains of magic accessible to a Spellcaster using a certain source of magic. The Arcane Spell List includes all manner of Spells that can be cast using Arcane magic. The same is true of other Spell Lists; the Divine Spell list includes Spells that can be cast using Divine Magic, and the Primal Spell list includes Spells that can be cast using Primal Magic.

## Arcane

Arcane magic draws power from unrefined, raw, chaotic magical sources. This type of magic is used by mortal beings, covers a wide variety of unique Spells, and can be cast using incantations, rituals, runes, and other forms of organization that transforms raw magic into structured forms. Wizards, Warlocks, and Bards are the primary practitioners of this type of magic.

## Divine

Divine magic draws power from divine beings, such as deities (greater and lesser gods), their followers (angels, archons, etc.), or the manifestations of abstract universal concepts (order, love, peace, war, etc.).

## Primal

Primal magic draws power from the physical embodiment of the universe (the land, air, rivers, and fires) and the natural creatures that abide within it (plants, animals, and nature spirits). Druids use Primal magic through their supernatural relationship with nature itself, while Shamans use powerful totems of nature to manifest aspects of its power (bear fortitude, bull strength, wolf smell, eagle sight, etc.).

## Gaining a Spell List

You can gain access to a Spell List through your Class's Spellcasting Feature (if it has one) or by selecting one from another Class using a Multiclassing Talent. When you learn a new Spell, you can select that Spell from any Spell List to which you currently have access.

**Example:** If a Spellcasting Feature grants you access to the Arcane Spell List but only to Spells within the Necromancy Spell School, then you can only learn a Necromancy Spell from the Arcane Spell List, unless another Feature grants you access to the Arcane Spell list without that restriction on Spell choice.

<!-- image -->

## Spell Resources

Each Spell has a minimum number of Action Points (AP) that must be spent to cast the Spell. Many Spells also include a minimum number of Mana Points (MP) that must also be spent to cast the Spell. This is known as the Base Mana Cost of a Spell.

## Action Points

All Spells require you to spend AP to cast them, with 2 AP as the standard cost for most Spells. Some Spells cost 1 AP (such as Cantrips) and usually have a lower base damage with modest effects. More powerful Spells have a higher AP cost (3 AP or higher) and deal greater damage or produce greater effects. These Spells may require a single Spellcaster to spend multiple turns to cast, or multiple Spellcasters working together (see 'Combo Spellcasting' on page 60 below).

## Mana Points

Each Spell has an MP cost that you must spend to cast it. There are different ways to spend additional MP on Spells, and the MP is spent when the Spell goes off successfully.

**Gaining Mana:** Your PC starts off by having 0 MP, but can gain MP in a few ways:

- **Spellcaster Class Feature:** If you choose a Spellcaster Class then you have a maximum number of MP equal to the amount of MP in the Mana Points column of your Spellcaster Class Table. You gain MP from this table from levels 1-10 and then you gain MP from your Prestige Path from levels 11-20.
- **Spellcaster Path:** If you spend a Path point on the Spellcaster Path, you gain bonus MP equal to the amount shown on the Mana Points column of the Spellcaster Path Table.

You Regain all of your Mana Points when you complete a Long Rest

**Missing with Mana:** When you spend MP to cast a Spell that deals damage, the target takes half damage on a Miss.

**DC Tip:** See 'Combat Resources' on page 39 for more information on Action Points and Mana Points.

## Spellcasting Without Mana Points

Certain Spells can be cast without spending MP. These Spells include special Spell Tags, such as the Cantrip and Ritual Spell Tags.

## Cantrips

Spells with the Cantrip Spell Tag don't have an MP cost, but can be empowered with MP to enhance their damage or effects.

## Rituals

By performing a 10 minute ritual immediately before casting a Spell with the Ritual Spell Tag, the Spell can be cast without spending MP even if it normally has an MP cost.

## Spell Enhancements

Spell Enhancements allow a Spellcaster to increase the potency of their Spells by spending additional MP on the Spell (or AP for Cantrips). Spell Enhancements are specific to each Spell and are included in a Spell's description. Many Spell Enhancements increase a Spell's damage (if applicable), its duration, its range, its number of targets, or its Area of Effect (if applicable).

**Performing a Spell Enhancement:** When you cast a Spell, you can spend additional AP or MP (stated in the Spell's description) to perform a Spell Enhancement with your Spell. If the Spell requires a Spell Check, you must choose to do so before you make the Check. You can perform the same Spell Enhancement multiple times per Spell, unless it's stated otherwise.

## Mana Spend Limit

You can spend a maximum number of Mana Points to cast a Spell equal to your Combat Mastery. This limitation includes MP spent on Spell Enhancements and other Features that require MP. This is called your Mana Spend Limit.

**Example:** A level 6 Sorcerer (Combat Mastery of 3) can spend up to 3 MP on any Spell they cast. They could cast a Spell with a base cost of 3 MP, or they could cast a Spell with a base cost of 2 MP and spend 1 MP on Spell Enhancements. Alternatively, they could cast a Spell without an MP cost, such as a Cantrip, and spend 3 MP on Spell Enhancements.

## MP Effects

These are abilities and effects (usually coming from Class Features) that cost MP and are very similar to what types of effects a Spell could cause. You can use an MP Effect (such as the Bard's Bardic Performance Feature) in place of a Spell for the purposes of a Spell Duel or Combo Spellcasting.

## Casting a Spell

When you cast a Spell, you must make a Spell Check to determine the Spell's degree of success or failure. Your Spell Check is compared against the target's Defense, the Spell's DC, or the target's Contested Check.

## Spell Check Vs Defense

These Spell Checks are compared against the target's Defense to determine whether or not the Attack hits the target. This type of Spell Check is called a Spell Attack. The Spell's description will state whether the Spell Check is made against the target's PD or AD (see Defense). If the result of the Spell Check is equal to or greater than the target's Defense, then the Attack hits.

## Spell Check Vs Spell DC

These Spell Checks are compared against the Spell's own DC. Some Spells have a Spell DC in order to fully cast the Spell as intended. The Spell is still cast on a failure (except for a Critical Failure) but at a reduced effect. Depending on the Spell's DC Success statements, exceeding the Spell DC by 5 or more may yield additional benefits.

## Spell Check Vs Save

These Spells impose an effect on its target (such as a Condition). The Spell Check is Contested against the target's Save. If the result of the Spell Check is greater than the target's Save, the target becomes subjected to the Spell's effect. Depending on the Spell's Save Failure statements, failing the Save by 5 or more may impose additional penalties on the target.

## Dynamic Attack Save

When a Spell you cast initiates a Dynamic Attack Save against the target, you make a Spell Check against the target's Defense (as shown above) and the target makes a Save against your Save DC. Your Spell Check determines if the Spell deals damage to the target. The target's Save determines if they're subjected to the effects of the Spell.

## Natural 1's

When you make a Spell Check and get a Natural 1 on the d20 the Spell does not go off and it fizzles. You still spend the AP for the attempt, but you don't spend any MP or other resources. This Spell Check still counts as a Spell Check towards the Multiple Check Penalty.

## Targeting Multiple Creatures

If a Spell you cast targets more than 1 creature, or includes more than 1 in an Area of Effect (such as an Arc, Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere), then you make 1 Spell Check against all creatures. Any Features you use to add extra damage only affect 1 target of your choice (not all of them).

**Example:** If a Wizard casts Fireball that covers an area that includes 4 creatures, the Wizard would make 1 Spell Check and compare it to the AD of each creature. If it's Spell Check is equal to or higher than a target's AD, it deals full damage against that target. If the Spell Check is lower than a target's AD, it deals half damage instead.

## Structure of Spellcasting Mechanics

When you cast a spell, you'll always make a Spell Check. Your result will be contested by one of 3 values depending on what the Spell does, and may also force the target to make a Save.

**Only Damage:** Your Spell Check is contested by a target's PD or AD.

**Only Effect:** Your Spell Check is contested by a target's Check or Save.

**Damage & Effect:** Your Spell Check is contested by a target's PD or AD, and the target makes a Check or Save against your Save DC.

## Spell Characteristics

## Components

There are 3 types of Components that a Spell could have. Some Spells require all 3 while some only require 1. In order to cast any Spell you must satisfy its Components outlined below.

## Verbal

These are the magical words and incantations needed to manifest the magical effects of a spell. This represents the PC uttering a few words to cast the Spell.

## Downsides

- Nearby creatures may hear you cast the Spell.
- If you are silenced by either magical or mundane means (Silence Spell or your mouth is gagged) you can't cast Spells with a Verbal Component.
- You can still speak underwater to cast a Spell, but you lose your Breath (see 'Breath Duration' on page 68).

**DC Tip:** From a Roleplay perspective, the PC could say a specific word, a phrase, a strange sound, or ignore this completely. It's just important for both GM and Player to understand that the PC is making a sound of some kind when casting a Spell.

## Somatic

These are the gestures, movements, and physical actions needed to control the magical energies within a Spell.

## Downsides

- Creatures that can see you may notice that you're casting a Spell.
- If your hands are bound or restrained from movement in any way, you can't cast Spells with Somatic Components.
- You need at least one free hand that's not holding anything to satisfy the Somatic Component. Having a Shield strapped to one hand does not count as a 'free hand'.

**DC Tip:** From a Roleplay perspective, the PC could move their arms around in a grand display, use simple hand gestures, or ignore this completely. It's just important for both GM and Player to understand that the PC is visibly moving their hand around when casting a Spell.

## Material

These are objects, items, ingredients, and other physical items needed to cast the Spell. Most Spells do not have Material Components required to cast them, but those that do usually either have a high gold cost or use an item that the GM can determine how rare they are.

**Persistent Materials:** Some materials aren't consumed when you cast the spell, and you're just required to have the materials when you cast the Spell.

**Consumed Materials:** These materials are 'burned up' once you cast the spell and are gone.

## Downsides

- You can't cast these Spells without having the Material Component.
- If the Spell consumes the Material Component, you must replace it before you can cast it again.
- Could have a high gold cost or be rare to obtain the item.

**DC Tip:** From a roleplay perspective, the PC could weave the Spell Components into their description of them casting a Spell. Players that want to add flavor to their spellcasting can create their own Material Components for a Spell (like slime from a frog to cast the Grease Spell). But these 'flavor' Components should not be held against them by the GM, unless the Player wants to track how many Spell Components they have.

## Duration

Spells can either be instantaneous or continuous in their duration, and some Spells require you to Sustain them in order to keep them going (see the Sustain Action below for more information).

## Instantaneous

Instantaneous Spells take effect the moment a spellcaster finishes casting the Spell.

## Continuous

These Spells last a specific amount of time. They can often end early when the affected creature Succeeds on a followup Save against the effect, it or another creature within 1 Space performs an Action to end the effect, or some of condition mentioned by the effect such as breaking line of sight occurs.

<!-- image -->

## Sustain Action

Some effects require you to Sustain them or they end. You must spend 1 AP at the start of each of your turns to Sustain an effect until the start of your next turn. You can't Sustain an effect while Dazed. When you become Dazed, any effect you're Sustaining immediately ends.

**Outside of Combat:** You can only Sustain 1 effect at a time outside of Combat. If you attempt to Sustain a 2nd effect while already Sustaining a first, the first effect immediately ends.

## Targets

Spells will declare a certain number of targets (one or multiple). A creature has to be inside of the Spell's Range or Area of Effect to be chosen as a target.

## Range

How far away can a target can be for the Spell to still be cast.

## Areas of Effect

The amount of area that the Spell takes up. This is represented in a zone of some kind in one of the following patterns below:

## Arc

An Arc forms half of a sphere. The Arc's size is expressed as a radius in Spaces that extends in a 180° arc from the point of origin in a direction of your choice. An Arc's point of origin isn't included in the Arc's area of effect.

## Aura

An Aura extends a fixed distance in all directions, but not through Full Cover, from an object, creature, or location, and moves with it. Unless stated otherwise, the object, creature, or location is subjected to the Aura's effect(s).

## Cone

A Cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length. A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect.

## Cube

You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side. A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect.

## Cylinder

Circle that also goes up vertically.

A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.

## Line

A Line is 1 Space wide and 1 Space tall, unless stated otherwise, and extends a fixed distance in one direction from an object, creature, or location. A Line's point of origin isn't included in the line's area of effect.

## Sphere

You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.

## Wall

A wall is a series of 1 Space squares connected to each other with at least one face adjacent to the face of another square. The width and height of a wall is assumed to be 1 Space unless otherwise stated. A length will always be given.

## Advanced Spellcasting

## Combo Spellcasting

If you and 1 or more creatures know the same Spell, you can join your resources together to cast the Spell as a team. This is called Combo Spellcasting.

**DC Tip:** Remember that MP Effects (such as a Bard's Bardic Performance Feature) count as Spells for the purposes of Spell Duels and Combo Spellcasting.

## Requirements

You must meet the following requirements to participate in a Combo Spell:

- You know the Spell.
- You have enough AP to cast and spend on the Spell.
- You're within 5 Spaces of at least 1 other participant.
- Each participant must share the same position in the Initiative Order (see 'Initiative Order' on page 64).

**Primary Caster:** Everyone participating in the Combo Spellcasting must agree on which of them will be the Primary Caster. They will act as the Spell's Point of Origin.

**Contributing Mana:** Each participants can contribute an amount of MP between 1 and their Mana Spend Limit toward the casting of the Spell. The total mana spent must be equal to or higher than the base MP cost of the Spell. The total MP spent on the Spell has no limit as long as participants do not exceed their own Mana Spend Limits.

**Example:** 2 creatures have a Mana Spend Limit of 4 each. By performing a Combo Spellcasting, they can combine their MP together, up to 4 MP each for a total of 8 MP spent to cast a Spell. By working together, they can produce a much more powerful version of a Spell they could normally cast individually.

**Highest Check & DC:** Every participant makes their Spell Check to cast the Spell. The highest Spell Check and the highest Save DC among them is used to determine the outcome.

## Stacking Magical Effects

A target can only be affected by a single magical effect of the same name (a single creature can only be mind controlled by 1 person). If there's a magical effect on a creature and you cast a Spell with the same effect, both casters must perform a Contested Spell Check to determine which Spell effect prevails over the target.

The Spellcaster who already has the effect on the creature doesn't have to spend any additional MP, they get to add a bonus to their roll equal to the base MP of the Spell they cast.

## Starting Combat

## Combat Encounters

Combat Encounters serve to slow the flow of time, allowing for precise resolution of actions during the chaos of battle. Combat consists of a Player Character (PC) Team and an opposing Enemy team. During Combat, time is divided into **Rounds**, which are further divided into **Turns**. The order each creature takes its turn in Combat is determined by the **Initiative Order**.

## Encounter DC

The Encounter DC represents the overall challenge of a battle, determining who reacts quickest and resolving uncertain outcomes. The Game Master sets a single Encounter DC, which serves as a baseline for the difficulty of various actions, environmental hazards, or other obstacles adventurers may face. The GM can refer to the Encounter DC Table below for example Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty values for PC Levels 1 to 20.

## Encounter DC Table

| Level | Easy | Normal | Hard |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 11 | 13 | 15 |
| 2 | 11 | 13 | 15 |
| 3 | 12 | 14 | 16 |
| 4 | 12 | 14 | 16 |
| 5 | 14 | 16 | 18 |
| 6 | 14 | 16 | 18 |
| 7 | 15 | 17 | 19 |
| 8 | 15 | 17 | 19 |
| 9 | 16 | 18 | 20 |
| 10 | 16 | 18 | 20 |
| 11 | 17 | 19 | 21 |
| 12 | 17 | 19 | 21 |
| 13 | 18 | 20 | 22 |
| 14 | 18 | 20 | 22 |
| 15 | 20 | 22 | 24 |
| 16 | 20 | 22 | 24 |
| 17 | 21 | 23 | 25 |
| 18 | 21 | 23 | 25 |
| 19 | 22 | 24 | 26 |
| 20 | 22 | 24 | 26 |

## Pre-Combat Aggression

<!-- image -->

The moment a Combat Encounter begins is not always a matter of strict timing. The GM may determine that a PC's action (such as drawing steel, loosing an arrow, or invoking a spell) triggers the clash, allowing them to carry out that action before Initiative is rolled. However, if the enemy is already on high alert or poised for battle, the GM may rule that combat begins before the action can be completed, requiring the character to take their aggressive move on their first turn instead.

## Initiative

Before Combat begins, the GM will call for Initiative, which determines the order in which each creature acts. The PC Team competes against the Enemy Team to determine which team takes the first Turn of Combat.

## Rolling for Initiative

When the GM calls for Initiative, each PC must make an **Initiative Check** against the **Encounter DC**.

## Making an Initiative Check

Roll a d20 and add your Combat Mastery and Agility to the result. Bonuses and Penalties to Agility Checks don't effect Initiative Checks, unless otherwise stated.

## Initiative Check Formula

| d20 + Combat Mastery + Agility |
|---|
| **DC Tip:** Initiative Checks aren't considered Agility Checks for the purposes of DisADV due to Heavy Armor with the Rigid Property or other things that specifically affect Agility Checks. |

## Individual Outcomes

Use the following Success and Failure Statements to determine the outcome of your Initiative Check:

- **Success:** You gain a d6 Inspiration Die, which you can add to 1 Check or Save of your choice that you make during this Combat. The Inspiration Die expires when the Combat ends.
- **Critical Success:** You gain ADV on 1 Check or Save of your choice during the first Round of Combat.
- **Critical Failure:** The first Attack made against you during the first Round of Combat has ADV.

## Party Outcomes

Use the following Success and Failure Statements to determine who will take the first turn in Combat.

- **Success:** If at least 1/2 the PCs beat the Encounter DC, the PC Team wins the first Initiative Turn of the Combat.
- **Failure:** If less than 1/2 the PCs beat the Encounter DC, the Enemy Team wins the first Initiative Turn of the Combat.

## Initiative Turns

An Initiative Turn is a creature's opportunity to act during Combat, allowing them to move, attack, cast spells, or take other available actions. There are 2 types of Initiative Turns: **PC Turns** and **Enemy Turns**. PC Turns belong to members of the PC Team, while Enemy Turns belong to members of the Enemy Team. The number of PC Turns and Enemy Turns is equal to the number of PCs, ensuring both Teams have an equal number of Turns.

<!-- image -->

**Example:** If there are 3 PCs in Combat, there will be 3 PC Turns and 3 Enemy Turns, for a total of 6 Initiative Turns in the Combat.

## Alternating Initiative Turns

Initiative Turns are arranged so that each Team takes one Turn at a time, so when a member of one Team takes a Turn, they're followed by a member of the other Team taking a Turn. This continues back and forth until each member of each Team has taken a Turn.

**DC Tip:** Using an alternating initiative system between teams creates a dynamic ebb and flow in Combat, ensuring both sides have opportunities to act before being overwhelmed. This prevents the pitfalls of all PCs acting in one overwhelming surge; either felling foes before they can react or suffering a brutal onslaught should the enemy strike first. By weaving turns between allies and adversaries, the battle remains engaging, tactical, and fair.

**Illustration:** The image below illustrates the Initiative Turn structure of two scenarios: the left scenario where the PC team beats the Initiative DC (PC Team takes the first Initiative Turn), and the right scenario where they fail instead (Enemy Team takes the first Initiative Turn).

<!-- image -->

## Choosing PC Turns

At the start of each PC Turn during the first Round of Combat, the PC Team will decide which PC will take that Turn. If multiple PCs want to take the same Turn, the PC among them with the highest Initiative Check result takes the Turn.

**Shared PC Turns:** If 2 or more PCs have the same Initiative Check result, they can choose to share a Turn. When they do, they act at the same time in the Initiative Order. They can choose which of them acts first or alternate their actions as desired.

**Example:** The Barbarian and Champion are going at the same time. They both spend 1 AP to charge in together and Flank an enemy. The Champion trips the enemy target Prone, and the Barbarian then makes an Attack Check with ADV (target is Prone) and +2 bonus to Hit (target is Flanked). They slay the enemy and charge off again together with their remaining Action Points.

## Choosing Enemy Turns

Enemies can each be assigned to their own Enemy Turns, grouped together into a single Enemy Turn, or divided into multiple Enemy Turns in any combination the GM chooses.

**Example:** There are 4 enemies in Combat. The GM can divide them into 4 different Enemy Turns, taking turns at different times in the Initiative Order. Alternatively, the GM could assign 2 enemies to 2 Turns each or 3 enemies to 1 Turn with 1 enemy alone in another.

**Assigning Enemies:** The GM can choose to assign enemies to the Enemy Turns all at the same time or one at a time as the Round unfolds. Enemies can be placed strategically to heighten the difficulty of the encounter, introduced into empty Enemy Turns later in the Initiative Order to bring forth hidden threats, or positioned immediately after a PC who has recently engaged or targeted them, allowing for a response driven by the narrative.

## Delayed Initiative

At anytime during your Turn, you can choose to permanently move your Turn to a PC Turn of your choice later in the Initiative Order. Alternatively, you can choose to delay your Turn until after an enemy that you can see. If that enemy occupies the last Initiative Turn in the Initiative Order, then you create a new PC Turn to act after them.

**Regaining AP:** When you delay your place in the Initiative Order, you don't regain your spent Action Points until the end of your new PC Turn in the Initiative Order.

**Example:** The A Rogue takes their turn during the first PC Turn in the Initiative Order. They want to delay their turn to act at the same time as the Cleric, who takes their turn during the 2nd PC Turn in the Initiative Order. The Rogue's turn is skipped over, and once its time for the Cleric to take their turn, both the Rogue and the Cleric can take their turns at the same time using the rules of Shared PC Turns.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Game Master Initiative Sidebar

Here are some bonus Tips for GMs to handle Initiative in some unique situations.

## Enemy Groupings

The GM may find it simple to group similar enemies together, rather than spacing them throughout the Initiative Order.

**Example:** If there are 4 Goblins with 2 Hobgoblins in a Combat Encounter with 4 PCs. The GM might add 2 Goblins to Enemy Turn 1, 2 Hobgoblins to Enemy Turn 2, and 2 Goblins to Enemy Turn 3.

## Unequal Number of Enemies

If there are fewer enemies than there are Enemy Turns, then the GM chooses which Enemy Turns they occupy in the Initiative Order.

## Shared Enemy Turns

When 2 or more PCs share a PC Turn, the GM can combine enemies from the next 2 Enemy Turns into 1 Enemy Turn, preserving the alternating flow of combat between the PC Team and the Enemy Team.

<!-- image -->

## Empty Enemy Turns

When an Enemy Turn becomes empty (whether because there's too few enemies to fill all Enemy Turns or all enemies in an Enemy Turn have been defeated), that Enemy Turn remains in the Initiative Order but is skipped. If new enemies enter the Combat, the GM may assign them to any empty or occupied Enemy Turns, allowing for their inclusion in the Initiative Order without disrupting the flow of battle.

## Multiple Enemy Teams

If there are two or more Enemy Teams, each Enemy Team will have their own Enemy Turns within the Initiative Order. These Initiative Turns will alternate so the PC Team, Enemy Team 1, and Enemy Team 2 will alternative Initiative Turns. To determine which of the Enemy Teams receives the first Initiative Turns, the GM can either use a Fate Check or simply choose based on strategy or narrative.

## NPC Team

Any NPCs that aren't hostile to the PC Team are considered their own NPC Team (such as civilians trying to escape a battle). The NPC Team has their own Initiative Turns separate from the PC Team and Enemy Team. These Initiative Turns will alternate so the PC Team, Enemy Team, and NPC Team will alternative Initiative Turns. The GM can assign NPCs to NPC Turns in the same way they assign enemies to Enemy Turns (see Choosing Enemy Turns earlier in this chapter).

**Important NPCs:** The GM can choose to consider an allied NPC as a member of the PC Team to allow the NPC to act during PC Turns in the Initiative Order. When you do, consider the NPC as a PC for the purposes of determining the total number of Initiative Turns (the number of PC Turns and Enemy Turns is based on the number of PCs in the Combat). The NPC takes a PC Turn of the PC Team's choice.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Initiative Order

The chosen Initiative Turns become the Initiative Order, which governs when each creature takes their respective Turns in each subsequent Round of Combat. Once the first Initiative Turn is assigned, Combat begins, all creatures gain access to their Action Points, the first Round of Combat begins.

## Rounds of Combat

During Combat, creatures take Turns maneuvering around the battlefield, attacking their enemies, or supporting their allies. Once each creature has taken their first Turn in Combat, the first Round of Combat is completed, and the next Round can begin. Combat progresses, Round by Round, until the PCs or their enemies prove victorious, and the GM declares that Combat has ended.

## Time in Combat

A Round of Combat lasts 12 in-game seconds, so 5 Rounds equals 1 minute of in-game time. You can imagine each creature's Turn happening near simultaneously to each other with some creatures acting split-seconds before others.

## Time in Combat

- **1 round of Combat = 12 seconds**
- **5 rounds of Combat = 1 minute**

## Duration in Rounds

The duration of some effects are measured in Rounds. The duration of these effects are measured from the start of the creature's Turn they're produced until the start of that same creature's Turn the specified number of Rounds later.

**Example:** If an effect with a duration of 1 Round was produced on a creature's Turn, that effect would persist until the start of that creature's next Turn. If the effect lasted 2 Rounds, then the effect would persist until the start of that creature's Turn 2 Rounds later.

**DC Tip:** Referring to the first Round of Combat means the first 12 seconds, where each creature will have 1 Turn. But if a PC uses an ability that lasts for 1 Round, that effect still lasts 12 seconds (which means each creature will have 1 Turn since the use of that ability), and it would last until the start of that creature's next Turn.

## Surprise in Combat

Not all combatants are prepared for battle, and some may find themselves caught off guard at the start of a Combat Encounter. To successfully ambush an opposing Team, your side must be able to see them while remaining unseen in return. If this condition is met and the GM calls for Initiative, any creature unaware of the impending fight gains the Surprised Condition until the end of their first Turn in Combat, leaving them unable to act as battle erupts.

## Surprised (Condition)

Your current and maximum AP are reduced by 2.

**Beta Note:** Monsters with Legendary Action Points (LAP) can take special actions in-between the PC's turns, spending up to a specified amount of LAP at a time (1 or 2 LAP per turn). Delayed Initiative can create a scenario where all the PCs delay their turns to act during the same PC Turn. This means there's only 1 big PC Turn, so the Monster with LAP can't spend all their LAP during the Round. Due to this issue, please run your monsters with LAP using this rule until we update it in the Monster Guide later: 'If a monster with LAP doesn't spend all its LAP during the Round (between PC turns), it can spend any remaining LAP it has at the end of the Round, just before it regains all its LAP.'

## CHAPTER 3: General Rules

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Environment

## Spaces & Distance

Distance is measured using Spaces, like the Spaces on a Grid Map. A Space can be measured in feet or meters, where 1 Space is equal to 5 feet or 1.5 meters.

**DC Tip:** 1 Foot is roughly 30 Centimeters, so you can quickly convert from Feet to Centimeters by multiplying the number of Feet by 30.

**Grid Map Distance:** When moving or measuring distance on a gridded map, moving in any direction counts as 1 Space (including moving diagonally). You can alternatively measure in straight lines between points if you have the measuring tools or templates to do so.

**Example:** The normal range of a Longbow is 30 Spaces. To determine its range on a Grid Map just count 30 Spaces in any direction. The Longbow's range could also be expressed as 150ft or 45m.

When tracking distance across long distances, such as from one town to another, you might want to measure distance using feet or meters instead.

**DC Tip:** Using Spaces to track distance in Combat makes things easier for determining how far a creature can move or the range of an effect. If something has a range of 10 Spaces, then that's 10 Spaces on the Grid Map.

## Difficult Terrain

Some terrain is more difficult to move through due to obstacles in the way (such as plants, rocks, fallen debris, other creatures, etc.). This type of terrain is more difficult to traverse than normal.

While moving through Difficult Terrain, you are Slowed (every 1 Space moved costs 2 Spaces of movement).

## Jumping

Jumping is a form of movement. A creature must have means of gaining movement in order to perform a jump. If a creature does not have enough movement to jump the maximum distance possible, its jump distance is shortened to the maximum movement available.

There are two types of jumps: a **Long Jump** and a **High Jump**. A Long Jump represents the distance a creature can move while jumping horizontally, and a High jump represents the distance a creature's feet can reach above the ground when jumping vertically.

## Jump Distance

A creature's Jump Distance is equal to its Agility (minimum of 1).

Jump Distance = Agility

**Running Jump:** After moving at least 2 Spaces, a creature can perform a Long Jump (horizontal jump) or a High Jump (vertical jump). If performing a Long Jump, it can jump its Jump Distance in Spaces. If performing a High Jump, it can jump its Jump Distance in feet (1ft = 30cm).

**Standing Jump:** A creature can forgo moving at least 2 Spaces before performing a jump, however its maximum Jump Distance is halved for the jump.

## Long Jump

<!-- image -->

## High Jump

High Jump = Jump Distance (in feet)

**High Jump Example:** A creature has a Jump Distance of 3. If that creature takes the Move Action to gain 4 Spaces of movement, it can move 2 Spaces to perform a High Jump that can reach up to 3ft (90cm) above the ground.

## Vertical Reach

The maximum height a creature can reach with its arms is equal to 1.5 times its height. A creature with a height of 6ft (1.8m) can reach something 9ft (2.7m) above the ground with its arms. A creature's vertical reach is added to its High Jump when determining how high it can reach during the jump.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Falling

When a creature begins falling, it immediately falls up to 100 Spaces.

**Falling Damage:** When a creature falls from a height more than its Agility in Spaces (minimum of 1 Space) and collides with the ground, an object, or a creature it takes True damage equal to the number of Spaces it fell (up to a maximum of 100 damage).

**Reduced Impact:** A creature that's going to take damage from Falling can make an Acrobatics Check to potentially reduce the Falling damage and avoid falling Prone. The DC equals **10 + 1 per each Space it falls**. **Success:** It reduces the damage by an amount equal to its Agility (minimum of 0). **Failure:** It falls Prone.

**Example:** If a PC has an Agility of 2 and falls from a height of 2 Spaces, they can make a DC 12 (10 + a 2 Space Fall) Acrobatics Check, and on a Success they take 0 damage (2 Space Fall-2 Agility = 0 damage). If that same PC falls from a height of 3 Spaces, they can make a DC 13 Acrobatics Check, and on a Success they take 1 True damage (3 Space Fall-2 Agility = 1 damage).

## Controlled Falling

If you are falling intentionally and are in control of your body and movement, it is considered a Controlled Fall. There are no additional penalties to falling in this way.

## Uncontrolled Falling

If you are thrown off a ledge, knocked back from an explosion, unable to react, or restrained in some way, it is considered an Uncontrolled Fall (GM discretion).

**Uncontrolled Impact:** If you are uncontrollably falling, the DC of Reduced Impact increases by 5. Additionally, you take damage when falling from any height (regardless of your Agility).

**Example:** If a PC has an Agility of 3 and has a Controlled Fall from a height of 3 Spaces, they can make a DC 13 Acrobatics Check, and on a Success they take 0 damage (3 Space Fall-3 Agility = 0 damage). If that same PC has an Uncontrolled Fall from a height of 3 Spaces, they would make a DC 18 (DC 13 + 5) Acrobatics Check instead.

## Continuous Falling

If you are still falling at the end of your turn, you immediately fall another 100 Spaces.

## Falling While Flying

If you are knocked Prone while flying, you immediately fall up to 100 Spaces unless you are magically held aloft. If you are still falling at the start of your turn, you can spend 2 Spaces of movement to end the Prone Condition on yourself (as if standing up in mid air).

## Climbing

Creatures that lack a Climb Speed are Slowed 1 while climbing. A creature can climb a ladder, a knotted rope, or along a pocketed wall without requiring a Climbing Check (Athletics). Climbing a slick rope or wall may require a Climbing Check. Creatures with a Climb Speed have ADV on Climbing Checks. The table below provides guidance on setting the DC for challenging climbs. **Failure:** The creature immediately falls.

| Difficulty | DC 10 |
|---|---|
| Soft or Mushy | +5 |
| Wet or Icy | +5 |
| Flat | +10 |
| Upside Down | +10 |

**DC Tip:** Climbing great distances can be challenging, so the GM may ask a PC to make a DC 10 Climbing Check for every additional 4 Spaces they climb beyond the first 4 Spaces, even if the rope or surface is normally easy to climb short distances. Creatures with Climbing Speeds wouldn't need to make these Checks.

## Swimming

Creatures that lack a Swim Speed are Slowed 1 while swimming. A creature can swim for 20 Spaces (100ft / 30m) in still waters without requiring a Swimming Check (Athletics). Swimming in a turbulent body of water without a Swim Speed requires a Swimming Check. The table below provides guidance on setting the DC for challenging swims. **Failure:** The creature fails to move and sinks 2 Spaces into the body of water.

| Difficulty | DC 10 |
|---|---|
| Choppy | +5 |
| Icy | +5 |
| Swampy | +5 |
| Stormy | +10 |

**DC Tip:** Swimming great distances can be challenging, so the GM may ask a PC to make a DC 10 Swimming Check for every additional 20 Spaces they swim beyond the first 20 Spaces, even if the water is still. Creatures with Swimming Speeds wouldn't need to make these Checks.

<!-- image -->

## Holding Your Breath

Creatures that require air to breathe can hold their breath to avoid breathing in toxic air, drowning underwater, or suffocating in an airless vacuum. A creature that can no longer hold its breath begins **Suffocating**. The amount of time a creature can hold its breath depends on the type of stress they are exposed to and energy they're exerting.

There are two types of measures to hold your breath: a **Calm Hold** and a **Stressed Hold**. A Calm Hold represents the duration a creature can hold its breath while in a low stress environment while doing little to no activity, and a Stressed Hold represents the time a creature can hold its breath while in a high stress environment while doing lots of activity.

## Breath Duration

A creature's Breath Duration is equal to its Might (minimum of 1).

Breath Duration = Might

## Calm Hold

Calm Hold = Breath Duration (in minutes)

A creature that is performing No Activity or Light Activity in a calm environment can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to its Breath Duration. If a creature begins performing any Strenuous Activity or Dangerous Activity, any remaining minutes of air is converted to an equal number of rounds.

**Calm Hold Example:** A creature has a Breath Duration of 3. If that creature decides to hold its breath while standing still in a calm environment, it can hold its breath for up to 3 minutes.

**No Activity:** Lying down, meditating, or contemplating while idle.

**Light Activity:** Non-strenuous activity that requires little effort, such as reading, bandaging wounds, and standing watch.

## Stressed Hold

Stressed Hold = Breath Duration (in rounds)

A creature that is performing Strenuous Activity or Dangerous Activity can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to its Breath Duration.

**Stressed Hold Example:** A creature has a Breath Duration of 3. If that creature decides to hold its breath while fighting a sea monster underwater, it can hold its breath for up to 3 rounds or 36 seconds (1 round is 12 seconds).

**Strenuous Activity:** Any activity that requires physical exertion, such as traveling, foraging, exercising, training, or casting Spells.

**Dangerous Activity:** Any activity that causes extreme injury or stress, such as engaging in combat with a hostile creature.

**DC Tip:** Remember, 1 Round in Combat is 12 seconds. That means that 1 minute is equal to 5 Rounds of Combat.

## Losing Your Breath

**Speaking:** Creatures that attempt to speak while holding their breath, such as to satisfy the Verbal Component required to cast a Spell, reduce their Breath Duration by 1.

**Knocking the Wind Out:** Whenever you take damage, you must make a Might Save. The DC equals 10 or twice the damage taken (whichever is higher). **Failure:** You lose 1 round of air.

**DC Tip:** Certain effects and abilities can cause a creature to begin Suffocating immediately, usually by knocking the air out of a creature or by constricting it.

## Suffocating

At the start of each of your turns, you suffer the following effects while you're Suffocating:

- **Loss of Consciousness:** You must make a DC 10 Might Save. **Failure:** You fall Unconscious. **Success:** You remain conscious, but the DC increases by 5.
- **HP Reduction:** You take an amount of True damage equal to 1/4 your Maximum HP.

These effects can't be reversed by any means until you regain the ability to breathe again.

<!-- image -->

## Vision

## Line of Sight

Line of Sight refers to a creature being able to see something within their field of view. If a PC watches a creature run behind a castle wall, that creature is no longer in the PC's Line of Sight.

On a grid map, this would mean that you can draw a straight line from any one corner of the Space that you're on to any one corner of a Space that the other creature is on. If you can see a creature but they're partially behind something (a wall, another creature, etc.), then they have Cover (see below).

## Cover

**1/2 Cover:** Creatures have a -2 penalty on Attack Checks and Spell Checks against a target's PD or AD while the target is behind 1/2 Cover.

A creature benefits from 1/2 Cover when it's hiding behind a chair, a small table, or another creature of the same size or larger.

**3/4 Cover:** Creatures have a -5 penalty on Attack Checks and Spell Checks against a target's PD or AD while the target is behind 3/4 Cover.

A creature benefits from 3/4 Cover when it's hiding behind a large piece of furniture, a creature 2 sizes larger than it or larger, or partially covered by a wall.

**Full Cover:** Creatures can't make Attack Checks or Spell Checks against a target's PD or AD while the target is behind Full Cover.

A creature benefits from Full Cover when it's completely behind an object that is larger than it.

**Illustration:** The image below illustrates how Line of Sight and Cover work in DC20. Player A would have No Cover, Player B would have 1/2 Cover, Player C would have 3/4 Cover and Player D has Full Cover from the Enemy.

## Concealment

**Partially Concealed:** A creature is Partially Concealed while within an area of thin fog, moderate foliage, or Dim Light. Creatures have DisADV on Awareness Checks made to see things that are Partially Concealed.

**Fully Concealed:** A creature is Fully Concealed while in an area that blocks vision entirely, such as Darkness, thick fog, or dense foliage. Creatures are considered Blinded for the purposes of seeing things that are Fully Concealed.

## Illumination

The illumination of an area can effect a creature's ability to see. There are 3 levels of illumination: **Bright Light**, **Dim Light**, and **Darkness**. Unless otherwise stated, this book assumes all creatures are in an area of Bright Light.

Anytime a source of light produces Bright Light with a listed radius, then that source of light also produces Dim Light that extends out an equal distance beyond the Bright Light. Beyond the radius of Dim Light is only Darkness, unless there is another source of light illuminating the area.

**Example:** If a campfire produces Bright Light with a 5 Space radius, then it also produces Dim Light with a 5 Space radius. The result is that the campfire produces 5 Spaces of Bright Light followed by another 5 Spaces of Dim Light in all directions.

## Bright Light

Bright Light fully illuminates everything within its area, allowing creatures to see normally. Most sources of mundane fire produces an area of Bright Light, such as torches, lanterns, or campfires.

**Sunlight:** Sunlight is a special form of Bright Light that illuminates the land while the sun is present in the sky. Some creatures, such as Vampires, suffer penalties while in an area of Sunlight.

## Dim Light

Dim Light only partially illuminates an area, allowing creatures to see with difficulty. Dim Light fills the area between the boundaries of Bright Light and Darkness. The area covered by a shadow, the light of a full moon, and the light produced by dusk and dawn are all examples of Dim Light.

**Seeing in Dim Light:** Unless a creature has Darkvision or another means to see normally in Dim Light, they perceive things within Dim Light as Partially Concealed (DisADV on Awareness Checks to see them).

**Example:** A creature carries a torch that sheds 3 Spaces of Bright Light followed by another 3 Spaces of Dim Light in all directions. The creature can see things within the Bright Light normally, making Awareness Checks as called for by the GM. However, the creature has DisADV on any Awareness Checks it makes to see things that are within the Dim Light.

<!-- image -->

## Darkness

Darkness is an area that lacks any form of illumination, making it impossible for creatures to see. Nighttime between dusk and dawn, an unlit room, or an underground tunnel are examples of Darkness.

**Seeing in Darkness:** Unless a creature has Darkvision or another means to see partially or normally in Darkness, they perceive things within Darkness as Fully Concealed (Blinded to see them). While in an area of Darkness, a creature can't see anything within the area, but it can still see areas of Dim Light or Bright Light that are within its Line of Sight.

**Example:** A creature is in an area of Darkness that extends in all directions as far the horizon, making them unable to see anything at all, including themself. However, if a source of light were produced somewhere within the creature's Line of Sight (such as a distant campfire), the creature would remain Blinded to all things except that area of illumination (whether Dim Light or Bright Light).

## Magical Light & Darkness

There are also sources of Magical Light and Magical Darkness coming out in the Beta.

## Vision

## Darkvision

Creatures with Darkvision have the ability see in Dim Light and Darkness out to a specified range. A creature with Darkvision can see areas of Dim Light within the specified range as if it were Bright Light, and see areas of Darkness within the specified range as if it were Dim Light. A creature can't discern color using their Darkvision, only shades of grey.

**Example:** A creature with Darkvision 10 can see up to 10 Spaces in Dim Light as if it were Bright Light, and up to 10 Spaces in Darkness as if it were Dim Light.

## Tremorsense

Creatures with Tremorsense can sense vibrations in the ground within a specified range, allowing them to automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the same surface, including through Cover and Concealment.

Creatures with Tremorsense and a Swim Speed can also pinpoint the location of creatures moving through water within the specified range.

## Blindsight

Creatures with Blindsight have the ability to see things within a specified range without the use of eyes. Creatures without eyes or that can see using echolocation are able to see things using Blindsight. A creature with Blindsight is immune to being Blinded, can see things that are Invisible, and can see unimpeded by Concealment. Blindsight doesn't grant a creature the ability to see behind Cover.

**Example:** A creature with Blindsight 5 can see up to 5 Spaces in any direction as if they could see normally. This includes Invisible creatures within range and creatures that are Partially or Fully Concealed within range that aren't behind Cover.

## Truesight

Creatures with Truesight have the ability to see things that are normally imperceptible out to a specified range. They can see through normal and magical Darkness, see into the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane (and vice versa), see things that are Invisible, automatically see through illusions, and can perceive the true form of a Shapechanger or creature that is transformed by magic.

**Example:** A creature with Truesight 10 can see up to 10 Spaces in Darkness normally, see creatures within range that are Invisible or on the Ethereal Plane, and see the true form of a any creature that is shapeshifted.

## Creatures & Combat

## Creatures

## Creature Sizes

Creatures come in many different shapes and sizes ranging from a miniscule bug to a primordial titan and beyond. The number of Spaces a creature occupies determines its size for the purposes of rules that govern the interactions between creatures and their environment. The table below shows the 9 different creatures sizes with examples for each and the number of Spaces they occupy.

| Size | Examples | Spaces |
|---|---|---|
| Micro | Spider | See Micro Creatures below |
| Tiny | Cat | 1/4 Space (4 per Space) |
| Small | Sheep | 1 Space |
| Medium | Human | 1 Space |
| Large | Horse | 4 Spaces: (2 x 2) or (4 x 1) |
| Huge | Elephant | 9 Spaces: (3 x 3), (4 x 2), or (9 x 1) |
| Gargantuan | T-Rex | 16 Spaces: (4 x 4), (5 x 3), (8 x 2), or (16 x 1) |
| Colossal | Brontosaurus | 25 Spaces: (5 x 5), (6 x 4), (8 x 3), (12 x 2), or (25 x 1) |
| Titanic | Blue Whale | 50 Spaces: (7 x 7), (8 x 6), (10 x 5), (12 x 4), (16 x 3), (25 x 2), or (50 x 1) |

**Micro Creatures:** Exceptionally small creatures, such as ants, can share their Space with other creatures. They can end their turn in a Space occupied by other creatures (and vice versa).

## Moving & Grappling Creatures

Creatures of different sizes have bonuses or penalties when attempting to Grapple, push, move, and knock other creatures Prone by mundane means.

- If you are 1 or more sizes larger than your target, you have ADV on such Checks and Saves.
- If you are 1 size smaller than your target, you have DisADV on such Checks and Saves.
- If you are 2 or more sizes smaller than your target, they are immune to such Checks and Saves.

**Example:** If a Medium sized Champion is trying to move a Large sized creature, the Champion would have DisADV on the Check they make to move it.

## Grappled

You're Immobilized.

## Escape Grapple

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to free yourself from a Grapple. Make a Martial Check contested by the Grappler's Athletics Check. **Success:** The Grapple immediately ends.

The Grapple also ends if any of the following occurs:

- **Incapacitated:** The Grappler becomes Incapacitated.
- **Falling:** The Grappler is unable to carry your weight when you begin falling, provided they aren't also falling with you.
- **Forced Movement:** An effect forcibly moves you or the Grappler, causing you to move outside the Grappler's reach. If the effect requires a Contested Check or Save, the Grappler makes the Check or Save instead of you. If the effect targets both you and the Grappler, the Grappler makes 1 Check or Save for both of you. **Success:** The targets are not moved. **Failure:** The targets are moved.

## Grappled by Multiple Creatures

A creature that's Grappled by more than 1 creature only suffers the effects of being Grappled once. However, a creature Grappled by multiple sources will remain Grappled until they're free from being Grappled by all sources.

**Example:** While Grappled, a creature is Immobilized (DisADV on Agility Saves). A creature doesn't have DisADV 2 on Agility Saves as a result of being Grappled by 2 creatures. They only have DisADV on Agility Saves.

**Moving the Target:** If multiple creatures are Grappling the same target and one of them tries to move the Grappled target, it must make a Contested Athletics Check against all creatures Grappling the same target. **Success:** It ends the Grapple on the target by all creatures other than itself, allowing it to move the creature as normal.

<!-- image -->

## Moving Through Creatures

While moving in Combat, there will be times when you'll want or need to move through another creature's Space. Whether the creature is friendly or hostile to you will determine if you can freely move through their Space.

**Friendly Creatures:** You can move through a Space occupied by a friendly creature without having to spend any extra movement.

**Hostile Creatures:** You can move through the Space of hostile creatures that are 2 sizes larger or smaller than you, but you are considered to be Slowed while moving through the Space they occupy. If the creature is within 1 size of you, you can't move through its Space unless you take the Pass Through Action (see 'Pass Through' on page 44).

**Ending Your Movement:** You can't end your turn in a Space that's occupied by another creature.

## Collision

When a creature is thrown or knocked back and collides with an immovable object (such as a wall) or another creature, it takes damage upon impact.8

**Sudden Stop:** A creature stops in the Space where it made contact with the object or creature.

**Collision Damage:** A creature takes an amount of Bludgeoning damage equal to the number of Spaces it couldn't travel (due to the collision).

**Example:** A creature is knocked back 5 Spaces and impacts a wall that's only 2 Spaces away. The creature would be thrown 2 Spaces into the wall and then take 3 Bludgeoning damage for the 3 Spaces they couldn't be moved (5-2 = 3).

**Creature Collision:** If a thrown creature or falling creature collides with another creature they both share the damage (each take half). See 'Shared Damage' on page 37 for more information.

**DC Tip:** In order to hit a target creature with a thrown creature there's usually an Attack Check, Athletics Check, or Contest that needs to be made. Otherwise this would just be 'automatic' damage to the target creature.

## Falling Attacks

If you want to put more force into an Attack Check, you can purposefully fall onto a target as part of your Attack Check.

To do this, you first need to move into a position to fall onto the target. Using the Creature Collision rules from above, you would count up the Spaces fallen and this number will represent the falling damage that will be taken. You can now make your Attack Check and resolve the damage based on the result. Then (regardless of if you hit or miss) you would share the damage taken from the fall. You would take half of the damage and the other half would be added to the damage they take as part of the same Attack Check.

**Example:** If you jumped from 4 Spaces up, and your Attack Check deals 3 damage, then the creature would take 5 damage (3 from Attack and 2 from fall) and you would take 2 damage (from the fall).

## Throwing

## Throwing Creatures

You can spend 1 AP to throw a creature that's Grappled by you that's the same size as you or smaller. Make an Athletics Check Contested by the target's Martial Check. **Success:** You throw the creature up to a number of Spaces away from you equal to 1/2 of your Might (ending the Grappled Condition) + up to 1 additional Space for every 5 they fail the Contest by.

**Smaller Size:** If the creature is a size smaller than you, the distance thrown is equal to your Might (instead of half).

**Vertical Toss:** You can choose throw the creature vertically into the air. When you do, they distance thrown is halved and it's subjected to damage from Uncontrolled Falling (see 'Uncontrolled Falling' on page 67).

**Team Throw:** If another creature has the same target Grappled, that other creature can spend 1 AP as a reaction to throw the target with you. You and the other creature each make an Athletics Check and add your results together to determine the total number of Spaces the target is thrown.

**Throw at a Target:** If you throw a creature at a target, you must make an Athletics Check and compare it to the target's PD. **Hit:** The thrown creature and the target share the Collision damage (each take half). **Miss:** The thrown creature continues traveling up to the distance thrown or until it impacts an immovable object (such as a wall) and takes full Collision damage.

**DC Tip:** When 2 or more creatures share damage, divide the total damage by the number of creatures (rounding up), and distribute the damage equally among the creatures (see Shared Damage for more information).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Throwing Objects

You can throw an object a number of Spaces depending on your Might and the object's size. For the purposes of throwing objects, your minimum Might is 1. The table below shows how far you can throw each size of object:

| Object Size | Spaces Thrown |
|---|---|
| 2+ Sizes smaller | 5 x Might |
| 1 Size smaller | Might |
| Same Size | 1/2 Might |
| Larger | Impossible |

**Example:** A Medium sized creature with a Might of 0 (minimum Might of 1) could throw a Tiny object up to 5 Spaces, a Small object 1 Space, and Medium object 1 Space (rounded up from 0.5). Conversely, if that creature had a Might of 6, they could throw a Tiny object 30 Spaces, a Small object 6 Spaces, and a Medium object 3 Spaces.

## Throwing Melee Weapons

When you throw a Melee Weapon that lacks the Thrown property as part of an Attack Check, the Weapon deals 1/2 its normal damage. The range of a Melee Weapon that lacks the Thrown property is 1/5. See 'Equipment' on page 75 for more information on Weapon properties.

**DC Tip:** Basically ALL Weapons have a default range of 1/5 (unless otherwise stated). This means within 1 Space you can make an Attack Check with no penalties and deal full damage with the weapon, but between 2 and 5 Spaces away your Attack now has DisADV and the total damage that it deals is cut in half.

## Improvised Weapons

Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an Improvised Weapons deals 1 damage of a type determined by the GM. When making an Attack Check with an Improvised Weapon you only add your Prime Modifier to your d20 roll, you don't add your Combat Mastery.

**Weapon Style:** Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an Improvised Weapon doesn't benefit from Weapon Styles or Weapon Properties.

**DC Tip:** If an Improvised Weapon is similar enough to an actual weapon, the GM might decide that it could gain certain Weapon Properties or even a Weapon Style.

## Unarmed Strikes

Unarmed Strikes deal 0 Bludgeoning damage. An Unarmed Strike is a Melee Attack made using any part of a creature's own body, such as a Punch, Elbow, Kick, Knee, or Headbutt.

**DC Tip:** Attacks that deal 0 base damage can still benefit from bonus damage, such as Heavy Hits, Power Attack Maneuvers, Class Features, etc.

## Natural Weapons

A Natural Weapon is a part of a creature's body that counts as a Weapon (such as a Claws, Fangs, and Horns). When you Attack with a Natural Weapon it's considered both a Weapon Attack and an Unarmed Strike.

**Wielding a Natural Weapon:** A Natural Weapon is considered to be wielded by the appendage it's attached to unless that appendage is holding something.

**Example:** A Beastborn with claws is considered to be wielding the claws in their hands, qualifying these Natural Weapons for Dual Wielding and similar mechanics.

## Non-Lethal Attacks

When you make a Melee Attack with a Weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can declare the Attack to be Non-Lethal. If a creature is reduced to 0 HP or lower by a Non-Lethal Attack, they are knocked Unconscious instead and are considered Stable for the purposes of Death's Door.

If a creature is knocked Unconscious in this way, another creature can spend 1 AP to shake them awake. When the creature awakens, they are on Death's Door at 0 HP, regardless of how much damage was dealt by the Non-Lethal Attack.

## Dual Wielding

You're considered to be Dual Wielding when you're wielding a separate Weapon in each hand. When you make an Attack with one of the Weapons you're Dual Wielding, your next Attack on this turn with the other Weapon ignores the Multiple Check Penalty (and doesn't advance that penalty), provided you're still Dual Wielding those Weapons. You can only do this once on each of your turns.

**DC Tip:** If one of your hands is a Natural Weapon (such as a Claw or the Monk's Iron Palm benefit), it counts as a Weapon you are wielding in that hand for the purposes of Dual Wielding.

## Flanking

You gain an additional +2 to your Melee Attack if the target is Flanked. A creature is Flanked when it has 2 or more enemies within 1 Space of it that are not adjacent to each other, provided they aren't Incapacitated or Prone. You're considered to be Flanking a creature if you are one of the creatures causing it to be Flanked.

## Prone

While Prone, you're subjected to the following effects:

- You have DisADV on Attacks, Ranged Attacks have DisADV against you, and Melee Attacks against you have ADV.
- **Crawl Speed:** Until you stand up, your only movement option is to Crawl, which costs an extra 1 Space of movement for every Space moved.

**Ending Prone:** You can end being Prone by spending 2 Spaces of movement to stand up.

## Prone in the Air

When you become Prone, you immediately enter an Uncontrolled Fall unless you're supported by a solid surface (see the Falling section for more information).

## Hidden Creatures

Creatures that are Unseen or Unheard are more difficult to discover.

## Unseen

You are Unseen by a creature while you're imperceivable to its visual senses, such as when you're Fully Concealed, you're Invisible, or it's Blinded. While Unseen, you're subjected to the following effects:

- You have ADV on Attacks against creatures that can't see you.
- Creatures that can't see you have DisADV on Attacks against you.

**DC Tip:** If you are Unseen because you're behind Full Cover, effected by the Invisibility Spell, and your target is Blinded, you don't gain the benefits of being Unseen multiple times. You are either Unseen or not.

## Unheard

You are Unheard while you remain silent, talk no louder than a whisper, or are within an area effected by the Silence Spell or a similar effect. While Unheard, you're subjected to the following effects:

- You have ADV on Attacks against creatures you're Flanking that can't hear you.

**DC Tip:** If you're Unheard because you're remaining silent or within an area effected by the Silence Spell, you don't gain the benefits of being Unheard multiple times. You're either Unheard or not.

## Hidden

You are Hidden from a creature while you are both Unseen and Unheard by it. Your location is unknown to creatures you're Hidden from.

**DC Tip:** If you become Hidden to a creature that's aware of you, it only knows your last location known to it before you became Hidden. Creatures that can detect your presence, even through magical means such as divination, are not considered to know your location, to see you, or to hear you unless the Feature says otherwise.

## Underwater Combat

While underwater, creatures are subjected to the following conditions:

**Attack Penalties:** Martial Attacks are made with DisADV using Weapons that aren't Crossbows or Spears. Creatures with a Swim Speed ignore this penalty. Additionally, Ranged Attacks automatically miss targets beyond the Weapon's normal range.

**Holding Breath:** Creatures that attempt to speak while holding their breath underwater, such as to satisfy the Verbal Component required to cast a Spell, reduce their Breath Duration by 1 (see 'Holding Your Breath' on page 68 for more information).

**Fire Resistance:** Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have Fire Resistance (Half) and are immune to Burning.

<!-- image -->

## Equipment

## Weapons

Every Weapon has a Weapon Type (Melee or Ranged), a Weapon Style (Axe, Sword, Hammer, etc.), and Weapon Properties (Reach, Thrown, Two-Handed, etc.).

## Weapon Types

There are 2 types of Weapons: **Melee Weapons** and **Ranged Weapons**.

## Melee Weapons

Melee Weapons use your Melee Range (see 'Melee Attack' on page 31).

**DC Tip:** Any Melee Weapon can be used as an Improvised Weapon to make a Ranged Attack. These Attacks have a Range of 5 spaces, are made with DisADV, and deal only half damage on a Hit.

## Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons have a Range of 15/45 (see 'Ranged Attack' on page 31).

**DC Tip:** A Weapon with the Long-Ranged Property has a Range of 30/90.

## Wielding a Weapon

A Weapon requires 1 hand when you Attack with it, unless it has the **Two-Handed** Property (requires 2 hands to Attack).

## Weapon Styles

While a PC with Weapon Mastery is wielding a Weapon, they can use that Weapon to benefit from its Weapon Style passive effect.

- **Axe:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Bleeding.
- **Bow:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Slowed.
- **Chained:** Your Attacks ignore Shields and 1/2 Cover, and you deal +1 damage against targets that are wielding a Shield or behind 1/2 Cover.
- **Crossbow:** You deal +1 damage against the last creature you Attacked with the Weapon since the start of your last turn. Additionally, you do not have DisADV on Attacks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.
- **Fist:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Grappled. Additionally, a Fist Weapon is considered to be a free hand when Grappling.
- **Hammer:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Dazed or Petrified.
- **Pick:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Impaired.
- **Spear:** You deal +1 damage against a creature if you moved 2 Spaces towards it immediately before making the Attack or if it is on a Mount. Additionally, you do not have DisADV on Attack Checks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.
- **Staff:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Hindered.
- **Sword:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Exposed.
- **Whip:** You deal +1 damage with Melee Attacks against creatures that are farther than 1 Space from you.

**Example:** A PC is wielding both an Axe and a Hammer. When they Hit a Bleeding creature with the Axe, they deal +1 damage against the target. They don't deal this bonus damage when they Hit the Bleeding creature with the Hammer.

## Weapon Properties

Weapons have certain properties that grant them different benefits or drawbacks.

- **Ammo:** This Weapon requires ammunition to make Attacks. You can load a Weapon as part of an Attack made with it.
- **Concealable:** Drawing the Weapon doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks. If you draw the Weapon as part of an Attack, you have ADV on the Attack. You can only gain this benefit once against each creature per Combat.
- **Guard:** You gain +1 PD while wielding the Weapon.
- **Heavy:** The Weapon's damage increases by 1.
- **Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
- **Long-Ranged:** Your Range increases to 30/90.
- **Multi-Faceted:** The Weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you must choose which Weapon Style to use. The chosen Weapon Style determines the Attack's damage type.
- **Reach:** This Weapon adds 1 Space to your Melee Range when you Attack with it.
- **Reload:** The Weapon's damage increases by 1, but you must spend 1 AP and use a free hand to reload the Weapon.

**DC Tip:** If you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon using a Reaction, the Weapon must already be loaded to perform the Attack.

- **Silent:** When you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you're Hidden from.

**DC Tip:** You must be both Unseen and Unheard to be Hidden. If you become seen while making the Attack, you are no longer Hidden.

- **Toss:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10).
- **Thrown:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (10/20).
- **Two-Handed:** The Weapon requires 2 hands when you Attack with it.
- **Unwieldy:** You have DisADV on Attacks made with the Weapon against targets within 1 Space of you.

**DC Tip:** The DisADV from Unwieldy stacks with the DisADV that Ranged Weapons get when they make Attacks against a target that are within 1 Space of you (making it DisADV 2).

- **Versatile:** This Weapon can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. When you wield the Weapon with 2 hands, you gain a +2 bonus to Hit using it.

## Special Weapon Properties

- **Returning:** When you Miss a Ranged Attack with the Weapon, it returns to your hand.
- **Capture:** When you Attack with this Weapon, you instead make a Martial Check contested by the target's Physical Save. **Success:** The target is Grappled by the weapon until it's freed. Forced movement doesn't end the Grapple, but teleportation does. **Success (10):** The target is also Restrained until it's freed. A creature can spend 1 AP to make a DC 10 Might Check. **Success:** It can free itself or another creature within its reach. Dealing 1 Slashing damage to the Weapon (PD 10, AD 10) ends the effect and breaks it, freeing the creature without harming it. A Weapon with this property deals 1 less damage. This Property has no effect on creatures that are formless, smaller than Small, or bigger than Large.

**DC Tip:** Attacks that deal 0 base damage can still benefit from bonus damage, such as Heavy Hits, Power Attack Maneuvers, Class Features, etc.

## Lacking Weapon Training

While wielding a Weapon you lack Training with, you do not benefit from its Weapon Style.

## Customized Weapons

You can create your own unique Weapons by following a 3 step process:

1. Choose the Weapon Type.
2. Choose the Weapon Style & Damage.
3. Choose the Weapon Properties.

## Step 1: Weapon Types

There are 2 types of Weapons: **Melee Weapons** and **Ranged Weapons**.

## Melee Weapons

Melee Weapon's use your Melee Range (see 'Melee Attack' on page 31) and deal 1 damage.

## Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons have a Range of 15/45 (see 'Ranged Attack' on page 31) and deal 1 damage. Additionally, they automatically gain the following properties: **Ammo**, **Two-Handed**, and **Unwieldy**.

## Wielding a Weapon

A Weapon requires 1 hand when you Attack with it, unless it has the **Two-Handed** Property (requires 2 hands to Attack).

## Step 2: Weapon Style & Damage

Each Weapon Style has a particular Weapon Style benefit and damage type (in parentheses) as shown below:

**DC Tip:** You can only benefit from a Weapon's Style if you have Weapon Mastery.

## Melee Weapon Styles

- **Axe:** (Slashing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Bleeding.
- **Chained:** (Bludgeoning) Your Attacks ignore Shields and 1/2 Cover, and you deal +1 damage against targets that are wielding a Shield or behind 1/2 Cover.
- **Fist:** (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Grappled. Additionally, a Fist Weapon is considered to be a free hand when Grappling.
- **Hammer:** (Bludgeoning) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Dazed or Petrified.
- **Pick:** (Piercing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Impaired.
- **Spear:** (Piercing) You deal +1 damage against a creature if you moved 2 Spaces towards it immediately before making the Attack or if it is on a Mount. Additionally, you do not have DisADV on Attack Checks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.
- **Staff:** (Bludgeoning) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Hindered.
- **Sword:** (Slashing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Exposed.
- **Whip:** (Slashing) You deal +1 damage with Melee Attacks against creatures that are farther than 1 Space from you.

## Ranged Weapon Styles

- **Bow:** (Piercing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Slowed.
- **Crossbow:** (Piercing, Requires: Reload Property) You deal +1 damage against the last creature you Attacked with the Weapon since the start of your last turn. Additionally, you do not have DisADV on Attacks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.

**DC Tip:** At the GM's discretion, you can use a Melee Weapon Style on a Ranged Weapon, and vice versa. GMs, be careful when allowing this for certain passives. For example, the Whip, Chained, and Spear Styles on a Ranged Weapon generate far more value than is expected and designed for within the system. You also might want to consider removing the “no longer having DisADV on Attacks made underwater” aspect of the weapon too if it wouldn't make sense.

## Changing Damage Type

Each Weapon Style comes with a default damage type (shown above), but you can switch any of these default damage types to a different one (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing).

## Step 3: Weapon Properties

When you pick a Melee or Ranged Weapon during Character Creation (or craft one later), you can grant it 2 additional Weapon Properties. You can't grant a Weapon the same Property more than once.

**DC Tip:** The Two-Handed and Unwieldy properties given to Ranged Weapons do not give you additional properties.

## Property Requirements

If a Weapon Property has a requirement, the Weapon must meet that requirement before you can add that Weapon Property to it.

## Melee Weapon Properties

These Weapon Properties are available to Melee Weapons.

- **(1) Concealable:** Drawing the Weapon doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks. If you draw the Weapon as part of an Attack, you have ADV on the Attack. You can only gain this benefit once against each creature per Combat.
- **(1) Guard:** You gain +1 PD while wielding the Weapon.
- **(2) Heavy:** (Requires: Two-Handed Property and Weapon Mastery) The Weapon's damage increases by 1.
- **(1) Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
- **(1) Multi-Faceted:** The weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you must choose which Weapon Style to use. The chosen Weapon Style determines the type of damage dealt by the Attack.
- **(1) Reach:** This Weapon adds 1 Space to your Melee Range when you Attack with it.
- **(1) Silent:** Ranged Attacks made using the Weapon while you are Hidden don't reveal your position to the creatures you're Hidden from.
- **(1) Toss:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10).
- **(1) Thrown:** (Requires: Toss Property) You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (10/20).
- **(-1) Two-Handed:** The Weapon requires 2 hands when you Attack with it. Can not be taken with the Versatile Property.
- **(-1) Unwieldy:** You have DisADV on Attacks made with the weapon against targets within 1 Space of you.
- **(1) Versatile:** This Weapon can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. When you wield the weapon with 2 hands, you gain a +2 bonus to Hit with it. Can't be taken with the Two-Handed Property.

## Ranged Weapon Properties

These Weapon Properties are available to Ranged Weapons. Additionally, you can spend 1 Property to remove the Two-Handed or Unwieldy Properties (or 2 Properties to remove both).

- **(2) Heavy:** (Requires: Two-Handed Property and Weapon Mastery) The Weapon's damage increases by 1.
- **(1) Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
- **(1) Long-Ranged:** Your Range increases to 30/90.
- **(0) Reload:** The Weapon's damage increases by 1, but you must spend 1 AP and use a free hand to reload the Weapon.

**DC Tip:** If you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon using a Reaction, the Weapon must already be loaded to perform the Attack.

- **(1) Silent:** When you made a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creature's you're Hidden from.

## Special Weapon Properties

- **(1) Returning:** (Requires: Toss Property) When you Miss a Ranged Attack with the Weapon, it returns to your hand.

**DC Tip:** When this weapon Hits, it falls to the ground.

- **(0) Capture:** (Requires: Chained or Whip Style) The Weapon's damage decreases by 1. When you Attack with this Weapon, you instead make a Martial Check contested by the target's Physical Save. Creatures that are formless, smaller than Small, or bigger than Large automatically succeed on this Save. **Check Success:** The target is Grappled by the weapon until it's freed. Forced movement doesn't end the Grapple, but teleportation does. **Success (10):** The target is also Restrained until it's freed.

A creature can spend 1 AP to make a DC 10 Might Check. **Check Success:** It can free itself or another creature within its reach. Dealing 1 Slashing damage to the Weapon (PD 10, AD 10) ends the effect, freeing the creature without harming it.

## Reskinning Weapons

Ultimately the Style and Properties of a Weapon you create are purely mechanical. With approval from your GM you can re-flavor the weapon to look like anything you want. You could make a Weapon that looks like a Sword but uses the Axe Weapon Style (so that you benefit from your target Bleeding instead of being Exposed).

**DC Tip:** The visual look of a weapon is just flavor. All similar-looking weapons don't have to function the exact same. Maybe your sword has a serrated edge and that's why you chose the Axe Style.

## Armor

Wearing Armor can improve your Defense and provide Damage Reduction. Creatures that aren't wearing Armor are considered **Unarmored**.

## Armor Type

There are 2 types of Armor: **Light Armor** and **Heavy Armor**.

## Light Armor

Light Armor is a type of protection worn by most creatures to protect them from injury. Leather coats, padded jackets, and heavy robes are types of Light Armor.

**Non-Metal Armor:** Light Armor can be described to be made of many things but is not made of enough metal to be considered Metal Armor for the purpose of game mechanics (Features, Spells, Weapon effects, etc.) unless otherwise stated.

## Heavy Armor

Heavy Armor is designed with greater attention in protecting the wearer in traditional warfare, requiring extensive combat training to use most effectively. Lamellar, laminar, and plate armor are types of Heavy Armor.

**Metal Armor:** All Heavy Armor is considered to be Metal Armor for the purpose of game mechanics (Features, Spells, Weapon effects, etc.) unless otherwise stated.

**Impactful Unarmed Strikes:** Your Unarmed Strikes deal +1 damage on a Heavy Hits while wearing Heavy Armor.

## Wearing Armor

It takes 1 minute to don or doff Light Armor, or 10 minutes to do the same with Heavy Armor. You gain the benefits of Armor while wearing it.

## Adventuring Supplies

## Gauntlet

You can purchase Gauntlets from a Blacksmith (or they come automatically with Heavy Armor). Wearing a Gauntlet gives your Unarmed Strikes with that hand the Impact Weapon Property (+1 damage on Heavy Hits).

**Beta Note:** Prices are not set for things like Gauntlets, so a simple 5g should be a good price for now.

## Healing Potions

Healing Potions are crafted to magically heal wounds when consumed. These are small (usually red) vials of liquid that are small doses but potent in healing.

## Healing Potion Levels

Healing Potions have levels to them that increase in potency and cost.

## Healing Potion Level Table

| Level | Healing | Price |
|---|---|---|
| X | 2 x Level in HP | |
| 1st | 2 HP | 10 |
| 2nd | 4 HP | 25 |
| 3rd | 6 HP | 40 |
| 4th | 8 HP | 60 |
| 5th | 10 HP | 100 |

## First Aid Kit

**Treat Wounds:** You treat a Bloodied creature's wounds. Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. **Success:** Target creature regains 1 HP. **Success (each 5):** The creature regains +1 HP.

**Cure Ailment:** You treat a Disease or Poison (of your choice) afflicting the target. Make a Medicine Check against the DC of the Disease or Poison. **Success:** You neutralize 1 Disease or Poison afflicting the target. **Success (each 5):** The creature regains +1 HP.

## Refilling a First Aid Kit

The reagents and bandages contained within the kit can be found in most towns and climates. Enough supplies for 1 charge can be bought for 5g at a general store. Alternatively, a creature can use a Rest Action to scavenge from an appropriate climate (GM's discretion) with a DC 15 Survival Check. **Success:** The kit regains 1 charge. **Success (each 5):** The kit regains +1 additional charge.

**Beta Note:** Rest Actions will be expanded on in future updates. Basically you can do this as part of a Long Rest (8 hours).

## Condition Resistance, Immunity, & Vulnerability

Condition Resistance represents a creature's ability to resist being subjected to Conditions, while Condition Vulnerability represents a creature's weakness against them. Where as Immunity prevents a creature from being affected by it at all. The source of a creature's Condition Resistance, Immunity or Vulnerability can be attained from a Class Feature, Ancestry Trait, Magic Item, Spell, etc.

## Condition Vulnerability

**Condition Vulnerability:** You have DisADV on Checks and Saves against the Condition.

**Example:** If you had Taunted Vulnerability, you would have DisADV on Checks or Saves against being Taunted.

## Condition Stacking & Overlapping

Certain Conditions can stack multiple times, increasing the potency of the Condition's effects on the target. Other Conditions overlap, keeping the same potency but becoming more restrictive.

## Stacking Conditions

A target can be affected by a Condition with an X value multiple times. If you gain multiple stacks of the same Condition, you add their X values together. If a stacking Condition doesn't include an X value, the value equals 1.

**Example:** If you were Exposed and another effect imposed the Exposed Condition on you again, you would become Exposed 2, causing Attacks against you to have ADV 2 (roll 3 d20s and take the highest).

**Durations:** When a creature is subjected to the same Condition multiple times but with different durations, it's important to keep track of the source of each Condition so you know when each Condition ends.

**Example:** You might be Exposed against the next Attack against you, Exposed until the end of your next turn, and Exposed for 1 minute, all at the same time. These effects stack, but you need to track them independently to make sure you know how 'Exposed' you currently are.

## Overlapping Conditions

A target can be effected by each of the following Condition multiple times, but the effects of the same Condition don't stack on the target.

## Charmed

A creature can be Charmed by more than 1 creature at a time, each of them gaining ADV on Charisma Checks against the target. However, a creature that Charms a target more than once only gains the effects of the Charmed Condition once.

**Example:** A creature doesn't have ADV 2 on Charisma Checks against a target they've Charmed twice. They only have ADV 1 on Charisma Checks against the target.

## Frightened

A creature can be Frightened by more than 1 creature at a time, suffering DisADV on Checks while any source that Frightened it within its sight and unable to move towards any source that Heavily Intimidated it within its sight. However, a Frightened creature only suffers the effects of the Frightened Condition once.

**Example:** A creature doesn't have DisADV 2 on Checks while 2 sources that are Frightening it are in sight. They only have DisADV 1 on Checks, regardless of the number of sources in sight.

## Restrained

A creature that is Restrained by more than 1 creature only suffers the effects of the Restrained Condition once. However, a creature Restrained by multiple sources will remain Restrained until they are free from being Restrained by all sources.

## Taunted

A creature that is Taunted by multiple creatures does not have DisADV on their Attacks against creatures that Taunted them. They can only move away from any creature that Taunted them if they are moving towards another creature that Taunted them.

**Example:** If a Goblin is Taunted by a Hunter, then later becomes Taunted by a Champion, the Goblin can only move away from the Hunter if they are approaching the Champion and can Attack both normally.

## Terrified

A creature can be Terrified by more than 1 source at a time.

**Example:** If a creature is surrounded by multiple sources, they are unable to move and can only take the Dodge Action.

<!-- image -->

## Tethered

A creature that is Tethered by more than 1 effect, must remain within reach of all the specified Tethers.

**Example:** If a creature is Tethered 5 Spaces by one effect, and then Tethered 5 Spaces by another effect, it can't move farther than 5 Spaces from either Tether.

## Excluded Conditions

The following Conditions don't stack or overlap in any way: Blinded, Deafened, Immobilized, Incapacitated, Invisible, Paralyzed, Petrified, Surprised, and Unconscious.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Resting

This happens during Exploration but are specific moments when PCs stop to rest and recover their resources, spend Rest Points, and perform specific Rest Actions. This could be 10 minutes, 1 hour, or 8 hours depending on the type of Rest being taken. These moments can include roleplay and descriptions of what happens, but they're primarily mechanical in nature.

## Rest Terms

**Rest Points:** You have a number of Rest Points equal to your HP maximum.

**No Activity:** Sleeping, meditating, or contemplating while idle.

**Light Activity:** Non-strenuous activity that requires little effort, such as talking, reading, eating, bandaging wounds, light foraging, and standing watch.

**Strenuous Activity:** Any activity that requires physical exertion, such as traveling, hunting, exercising, training, or casting spells.

**Dangerous Activity:** Any activity that causes extreme injury or stress, such as engaging in combat with a hostile creature.

## Types of Rest

## Quick Rest

A period of No Activity or Light Activity that is at least 10 minutes long. You can only gain the benefits of 2 Quick Rests per 24 hour period.

**Quick Rest Benefits:** You can spend 1 or more Rest Points, up to your maximum, at the end of a Quick Rest. When you do, you regain 1 HP per Rest Point spent.

## Short Rest

A period of No Activity or Light Activity that is at least 1 hour long. You can only gain the benefits of 2 Short Rests per 24 hour period.

**Short Rest Benefits:** At any point during a Short Rest, you can spend Rest Points to regain HP following the same rules as a Quick Rest. Some Features regain expended uses when you complete a Short Rest (as listed in the Feature's description).

## Long Rest

A period of 4 hours of Light Activity and 4 hours of No Activity, taken in either order, for a total of 8 hours of resting. If one of the 4 hour periods is interrupted by any amount of Strenuous Activity or Dangerous Activity, you must begin that 4 hour period again. You can only gain the benefits of 1 Long Rest per 24 hour period.

## Long Rest Benefits

At any point during a Long Rest, you can spend Rest Points to regain HP following the same rules as a Quick Rest.

**Half Long Rest:** At the end of the first 4 hour period of the rest, you gain the benefits of a Short Rest and regain all spent Rest Points.

**DC Tip:** Make sure to spend any unused Rest Points at the beginning of a Long Rest, since you regain all spent Rest Points after the first 4 hours of a Long Rest.

**Complete Long Rest:** At the end of the second 4 hour period of the rest, you gain the full benefits of completing the Long Rest. Some Features regain expended uses when you complete a Long Rest (as listed in the Feature's description), such as regaining all spent MP.

**DC Tip:** You might just want to take a Half Long Rest (4 hour rest) if you only need to regain HP.

## Doomed

When you complete a Long Rest, you lose all stacks of the Doomed Condition.

## Exhaustion

For each 4 hour period doing No Activity, you decrease your Exhaustion by 1. If you spend both 4 hour periods doing Light Activity, you must make a DC 10 Might Save. **Failure:** You gain Exhaustion 1 and the DC of this Save now increases by 5 until you complete a Full Rest.

## Full Rest

A 24 hour or longer period (determined by the GM) that is spent in an area of safety, such as a town, where you can eat well, rest, and recover. If the Full Rest is interrupted by any amount of Dangerous Activity you must begin it again.

**Full Rest Benefits:** At the end of a Full Rest, you gain the benefits of a Long Rest and lose all levels of Exhaustion. Your GM can determine if the Full Rest also grants additional benefits by choosing from the list below (or make up something that makes more sense in the given situation):

- Gain Temp HP equal to your Prime Modifier, your level, or twice your level.
- Gain ADV on a type of Check, Save, or both for a given period of time (1 day, 1 week, etc.).

## DCs in DC20

## Difficulty Class (DC)

Difficulty Class (DC) is the number that a Game Master sets as the level of difficulty required to be able to succeed in a given situation. Lockpicking a door, climbing a steep mountain, trying to persuade someone to give you something, or even trying to resist a Spell's effect over you all have a DC that needs to be met or exceeded in order to succeed.

You always roll a D20 and add whatever relevant modifiers there are based on what the Game Master asks for. Usually (unless you are attacking something) this is going to be a Check or a Save.

## Setting a DC 'by 5's'

Checks (in general) work on a 'by 5's' system. This helps to stay consistent and fair in a GM's ruling of how difficult something is to accomplish. Below is a chart with a quick reference, and examples are listed below that. These are meant to give Game Masters a foundation to use and players a general expectation to understand. If you want to get more specific, you can set any number you want as the DC.

**DC Tip:** I personally always have Checks be 'by 5's', but when it comes to setting a DC for combat related things I use more specific numbers. Things like the DC of a Trap or the DC of sneaking by a particular creature might be something like 12, or 14, or 17.

| DC | Task Difficulty |
|---|---|
| 5 | Very Easy |
| 10 | Moderate |
| 15 | Hard |
| 20 | Very Hard |
| 25 | Extremely Hard |
| 30 | Near Impossible |

Most DCs that you'll ask for will either be 10, 15, or 20. Once PCs reach higher levels and start trying to accomplish crazier and crazier things, a DC 25 or even 30 might come up.

- **DC 5:** This is a Very Easy DC that probably shouldn't even be asked for and would be easily accomplished by just about anyone, regardless of training. I usually don't ask for a Check if the DC would be 5.
- **DC 10:** This is a Moderate DC that should be doable, especially if you're skilled at the task. Checks that are simple but still have a small chance of failure are a DC 10 for me.
- **DC 15:** This is a Hard DC to hit for those who aren't skilled in this task. If a PC has a decent modifier of a +5 in a Skill, they would have around a 50% chance of success on this. This is my go to DC for when I really don't know if someone can do it or not and is one step beyond the 'moderate' DC of 10.
- **DC 20:** This is a Very Hard DC to hit unless you have training in this Skill. Even PCs with a +10 modifier would hit a DC 20 about 50% of the time. This DC represents something of great worth and something that would be Very Hard.
- **DC 25:** This is an Extremely Hard DC to hit. Even if the PC has a +5 in their Skill, they would still need a Nat 20 to just succeed on this DC. I reserve this for things that would be next to impossible at early levels of play, and would only be possible if the character that was attempting to hit this DC both had a good modifier to the roll and rolled well.
- **DC 30:** This is a Near Impossible DC to hit. It takes a lot for a character to get a +10 in a skill, and even if they did have a +10 they'd still need a Nat 20 to hit this. Reserve this DC for those Checks that are possible for the PC to accomplish, but it'd have to be a 'miracle' for it to happen (see Nat 20 and Nat 1 section below for more tips on when to ask for rolls).

**DC Tip:** The best way I can describe it is this. If I have a little bit of doubt that a PC could do it, the DC is 10. If there is a decent amount of doubt that they could accomplish this, then the DC is 15. If I am very doubtful that the PC could accomplish this, the DC is 20 and they better roll really high!

## Great Success and Failure

With 5 point increments you can dial things up or down based on if they beat the Check by 5 or fail the Check by 5. If the DC for climbing a castle wall is 15, a 15 would exactly succeed, but if they beat it by 5 and got a 20 or higher, maybe something cool happens like the guard at the top doesn't see them at all and they have a moment of surprise! On the other hand, if they got a 10 or lower on that same check (failing it by 5), maybe as they're climbing the wall they take too long and the guards spot them!

This 'by 5's' system also connects to the core of DC20's Combat system. In Combat, when you roll 5 over the target's AC you deal more damage than you would normally, so this can also be true for Skill Checks.

**Example:** Here is a general outline for what each possible scenario might look like in a given situation. This example is for a DC of 20:

- **14** = Failure
- **15** = Partial Success with a setback (they got close but didn't hit the DC)
- **20** = Success
- **25** = Major Success (you get some additional benefit)

**DC Tip:** You can also do the same for Checks that succeed or fail by 10 or more! I try not to make this be too game altering or punishing, but it's nice to add some flavor to those extreme rolls.

## Complications

Going 'by 5's' is also simple when it comes to figuring out complications to a situation. Let's say there's a scenario where a PC is trying to walk across a simple rickety wooden bridge, the DC for this could be 10 (depending on how rickety it is). Now let's say it started to rain, or a strong breeze picked up, so you can just dial the DC up by one 'notch' to a DC 15! Simple! Then, if you want to add in that the PC is being chased by bandits and needs to hurry across as arrows and people chase them, now it's a DC 20!

It's very simple to step the DC up or down depending on extra things that happen around the situation at hand.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

For things that happen in the world, I adjust the DC up or down by 5, or even get it to a specific number as previously stated. However, when the PCs describe something they do, Game Masters can award Advantage (ADV) or Disadvantage (DisADV) to their roll based on their actions. If they're talking to a city guard and let it slip that they stole something, the GM can give them DisADV on their Check. If a PC comes up with a clever way to use an item or lever to lift something heavy, the GM could give them ADV on their Check.

**DC Tip:** Don't be afraid to award ADV and DisADV for players' interactions with the world. This lets them know if they're 'on the right track' with their thinking or not.

## Failing Forward

When someone fails a Check of some kind, it doesn't always mean they literally didn't do what they were trying to. If someone tries to break open a door and they fail the Might Check for it, that doesn't have to mean that the door didn't break. It could break but make such a loud noise that the guards are alerted, or maybe they're unlucky and there's a guard directly on the other side of the door. You could even have them smashing the door in this way lower the DC for the next person to attempt something.

It can feel really bad and take forever if you gate progress of the story behind needing to hit certain numbers. This can bring the game to a screeching halt, so instead, let them fail forward. Let each moment move the story forward in an interesting way.

## Game Master Guide

## Variable Attribute Skill Checks

Each Skill has a Base Attribute that is its 'home' on the Character Sheet. This is the default Attribute you would add to each Skill unless the GM calls for something else. In most scenarios, you will find yourself using the Skill's Base Attribute.

**Example:** When your GM tells you to make an Athletics Check, that'll most likely be based off your Might Attribute. When your GM tells you to make an Influence Check, that'll most likely be based off your Charisma Attribute.

This keeps the game moving quickly and avoids confusion on which Attribute you add to a given Check. If you're interested in a more customizable and creative approach to Skills, then here is how the 'Variable Attribute Rule' works.

## Variable Attribute Rule

Which Attribute you use for a given Skill Check depends on how you're using the Skill. This is a much more open approach to Skill Checks, and can be used to create any possible Check.

**DC Tip:** Players can get creative with alternative Attributes for Checks, but the GM always retains the authority to decide which Check the player will make.

Determining the default Check can be straightforward, but what if the PC wants to use a different Attribute or Skill with the Check or the GM wants to make the Check more precisely match the actions of the PC? This is where the Variable Attribute Rule comes in. There are 2 things to determine when making a Variable Skill Check:

**Determine The Skill:** Which skill is the PC trying to use in this moment? Based on what they're trying to accomplish, the Skill being used is usually pretty obvious.

**Determine The Attribute:** Which attribute are they using to accomplish this task? How are they using their Skill? Are they using Might, Agility, Intelligence, or Charisma to make this Check? There are many ways to approach the actions a PC might take during gameplay. See the examples below.

**DC Tip:** The GM should ideally choose a Variable Check that is well suited for the PC. If the Variable Check is worse off for the PC, they can always just choose to use the 'default' Skill Check instead.

## Variable Check Examples

Here are some examples of Variable Attributes being applied to scenarios for some great Skill Check results. I challenge you to think of how you could combine each of the 4 Attributes to each of the 13 General Skills. The format for describing these Checks is 'Skill (Attribute) Check' with the Skill being the first word and the Attribute being used inside of the parentheses.

**Animal (Might) Check:** A PC is wrestling a wild boar.

- Yes, this could be an Athletics (Might) Check, and maybe for most characters, that's what it would be. However, if you have a unique character that has a really high Animal Skill, it might make more sense for them to use that expertise with animals to their advantage.
- Alternatively, when you try to quickly grab an Animal you could make an Animal (Agility) Check.

**Trickery (Charisma) Check:** A PC is trying to impersonate the speech or accent of another NPC to trick someone into thinking they're someone else.

- Yes, this could be an Influence (Charisma) Check, because they're talking to another NPC to convince them of something, but if a character has put a lot of points into Trickery, it makes sense for this 'sly' character to be able to impersonate people better than most.
- If they were trying to devise a cunning plan to sneak into a location and infiltrate it, they could make a Trickery (Intelligence) Check instead.

**Medicine (Agility) Check:** A character is trying to carefully remove metal shards from an ally.

- Yes, I know Medicine's 'home' is Intelligence, and I would usually have Medicine Checks be used to see if you know something about things having to do with medicine. This, though, is a careful application of your medical knowledge needing the use of agile hand movements. I could even see someone using a Medicine (Might) Check to perform CPR or to jam a dislocated shoulder back into place.

**Intimidation (Intelligence) Check:** A character is trying to convince an NPC not to go into the dangerous forests, so they start listing off a bunch of scary facts about how terrifying a beast that lives in this forest is.

- Intimidation can easily be any of the 4 Base Attributes. Breaking something in half would be Might. Throwing a dagger right next to someone's head barely missing them would be Agility. Trying to manipulate a creature's actions using a social threat, extortion, or blackmail, could be an Intimidation (Charisma) Check. If your threat involves knowledge of key information or about the target specifically, you could make an Intimidation (Intelligence) Check.

**Insight (Intelligence) Check:** A PC is trying to figure something out based on past experiences. You can think of this as a PC's intuition.

## CHAPTER 4: Character Creation Rules

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 10 Step Character Creation Outline

During Player Character Creation you will get to customize your PC in the following ways at Level 1:

- Choose Starting Attributes
- Choose Background (Skills, Trades, and Languages)
- Choose an Ancestry and Class

## Player Character Creation

## Step 1: Attributes & Prime Modifier

You get your PC Attributes from one of the following methods and then assign the values to each of the 4 Attributes.

## Standard Array

You start with an array of 3, 1, 0, -2 and assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain 2 additional Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

## Point Buy

You start with a -2 in all of your Attributes. You then gain 12 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**DC Tip:** Your Prime Modifier (see later in this chapter) comes from your highest Attribute, so it's a good idea to make sure that you get a 3 in at least one of your Attributes.

## Roll Method

You determine your starting values by rolling 1d6-3 four times, and then assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain +2 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**Prime Modifier Insurance:** If the value of your highest Attribute is less than 3 (even after adding the +2 Attribute Points), you can reduce a different Attribute value by 1 or more to increase your highest Attribute by the same amount. You can't reduce an Attribute value below -2 or increase an Attribute above your Attribute Limit (3).

**DC Tip:** This method of determining your starting Attributes is the most risky. It offers the potential for the highest starting Attributes, but also the lowest. If you add all your Attributes together, their sum should be 2 (on average). If you get less than this, then talk to your GM about potentially rerolling your Attributes (or using a different method).

## Prime Modifier

Your Prime Modifier is equal to your PC's highest Attribute.

**DC Tip:** You really want a PC to have a 3 in one of their Attributes so they can have a 3 for their Prime Modifier at level 1. Your Prime Modifier is added to a lot of the things you do in Combat and is very important.

## Step 2: Save Masteries

You add your Attribute bonus and your Combat Mastery together. The result is your Save bonus for each Attribute.

## Step 3: Background (Skills, Trades, & Languages)

This represents how your were raised, what type of culture you were around, and what you have done since birth. You gain 'Traits' from your Background at 1st level that grant you some flavorful or mechanical benefits.

Each Background gives 5 Skill Points, 3 Trade Points, and 2 Language Points. You can't go over the Mastery Limit of Novice unless you have a Feature that allows you to do so.

**Beta Note:** The only piece 'missing' from Background is a 'Background Trait'. This will be something that's 100% FLAVOR based and only enhances roleplay.

## Skills

Your Background gives you 5 Skill Points, but you also increase or decrease your Skill Points based on your Intelligence Attribute.

**Starting Skill Points = 5 + Intelligence** (yes, you do subtract if your Intelligence is negative).

## Trades

Your Background gives you 3 Trade Points. You can convert 1 Skill Point into 2 Trade points, but not the other way around.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Languages

Your Background gives you Fluency in the Common Language and 2 Language Points that you can spend on any Language of your choice. Additionally, you can convert 1 Trade Point into 2 Language Points.

## Background Starting Equipment

Coming Soon. You get a list of starting equipment based on your Background. You could instead choose to receive a flat amount of gold or even roll for your gold.

## Step 4: Health Points

Fill in your Character's HP. You may potentially add more if you choose an Ancestry or Class that grants bonus HP at Level 1.

**Starting HP Formula: Class HP + Might + Ancestry HP (if any)**

**Example:** A PC picks the Champion Class at Level 1 and starts with a Might of 3 (the highest possible at Level 1). The Champion Class grants a base of 9 HP. The PC then adds +3 HP from their Might to get a total of 12 HP (9 + 3). If any of their Ancestry Traits increase or decrease their HP, they would add those to the total to determine their starting HP.

## Step 5: Stamina & Mana Points

Fill in your Character's SP and MP. Martial Characters have 1 Stamina Point (SP), Spellcasters have 6 Mana Points (MP), and Hybrid Characters (such as a Spellblade) have 1 Stamina Point (SP) and 3 Mana Points (MP).

## Step 6: Defense

Fill in your Character's Precision and Area Defense.

## Precision Defense

PD = 8 + CM + Agility + Intelligence + Bonuses

## Area Defense

AD = 8 + CM + Might + Charisma + Bonuses

## Damage Reduction

Fill in each section's Damage Reduction.

**Physical Damage Reduction:** This only applies if you're wearing some types of Heavy Armor or Heavy Shields (or have some other feature that grants PDR).

**Elemental Damage Reduction:** This only applies if you're wearing some types of Heavy Armor or Heavy Shields (or have some other feature that grants EDR).

**Mystical Damage Reduction:** This most likely doesn't apply to your character (unless you have a feature that grants it).

## Step 7: Combat Modifiers

Fill out the rest of the blanks on your Character Sheet.

**Attack / Spell Check:** +4

**Save DC:** 14

**Martial Check:** Highest between Athletics or Acrobatics

**Death Threshold:** -4

**Move Speed:** 5

**Jump Distance:** Equals your Agility (minimum of 1)

**Rest Points:** Equal to your HP maximum

**Grit Points:** 2 + Charisma

<!-- image -->

## Step 8: Ancestry

Choose an Ancestry. This represents your biology and how you've grown and developed since birth. You gain Ancestry Traits from your chosen Ancestry at 1st, 4th, and 7th level.

**DC Tip:** There are many different ways to create Ancestries (both visually and mechanically). Make sure to collaborate where needed with your GM.

## Ancestry Traits

You choose 1 or 2 Ancestries to gain access to. You also get 5 Ancestry points that you can use to spend on Ancestry Traits (see 'Ancestry System' on page 104 for more).

**DC Tip:** Some of these Traits might affect things you've already added to your Character Sheet (such as HP, Speed, etc.).

## Step 9: Class

Choose a Class. This represents how well trained you are in martial combat, spellcasting, or both. You gain Class Features at Level 1, 2, 5, and 8.

All Classes get to choose a Subclass at 3rd Level, then gain additional Subclass Features at Level 6 and Level 9. Keep this in mind when creating your character, so that the flavor, backstory, and mechanics can blend well together when you get to Level 3.

**Example:** If you know you're going to choose a Draconic Sorcerer, you should probably flavor some of your PC's appearance or how they cast their magic as such.

**DC Tip:** If you don't know what you're going to select yet, that's fine too! I just recommend thinking about it.

## Class Features

You gain a number of Class Features at Level 1 based on which Class you chose (see 'Classes' on page 117 for more)

**Class HP:** All Classes have a Health Points column in their Class Table. Martials get +1 bonus Max HP every Level and Spellcasters don't get any bonus HP. Rogues and Spellblades get +1 bonus Max HP every other Level.

**Cantrips, Spells, Maneuvers Known:** Check your Class Table to see if you have any of these to pick.

**Skill Points:** If your background already gave you one or more of these Skills, you can replace those Skills from this list with any Skill of your choice.

## Step 10: Weapons & Inventory

Choose what starting equipment you want. You gain some from your Class and the rest from your Background.

**Beta Note:** Currently, this only includes Weapons and Armor. Starting Equipment will be added in a future update. I personally let my PCs choose from a list of general adventuring supplies and we go from there.

## Further Player Character Progression

Characters get stronger as they increases in Level. This chart shows what you get at each Level for all Classes.

**DC Tip:** This table is a general representation of what the 'standard' is for all classes, but make sure to check your Class specifically just in case.

## Player Character Progression Table

| Char Level | Combat Mastery | Attribute Cap | Skill Mastery Level Cap | Attribute Points | Skill Points | Trade Points | Features, Talents, & Traits |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 3 | Novice (1) | | | | Class Features |
| 2 | 1 | | | | | | Class Features, Talent + 1 Path Point |
| 3 | 2 | | | +1 | +1 | +1 | Subclass Features |
| 4 | 2 | | | | | | Talent + 1 Path Point, 2 Ancestry Points |
| 5 | 3 | 4 | Adept (2) | +1 | +2 | +1 | Class Features |
| 6 | 3 | | | | +1 | | Subclass Features |
| 7 | 4 | | | | | | Talent + 1 Path Point, 2 Ancestry Points |
| 8 | 4 | | | +1 | +1 | +1 | Class Capstone Features |
| 9 | 5 | | | | | | Subclass Capstone Features |
| 10 | 5 | 5 | Expert (3) | +1 | +2 | +1 | Epic Boon, Talent + 1 Path Point |

## Leveling Up

When a Character levels up these are the updates you need to make.

## Combat Mastery

At levels 3, 5, 7, 9 (all 'odd' levels) your Combat Mastery increases by 1. The following things that Combat Mastery and would also increase by 1.

- PD and AD
- Attack and Spell Checks
- Might, Agility, Charisma, and Intelligence Saves
- Save DC

## Attribute Points

Check your Player Character Progression Table and see if you gain any Attribute points.

- If you increase an Attribute, then you must also increase each Skill that's connected to that Attribute by the same amount.
- Possibly increase your Prime Modifier if you just increased your highest Attribute to be higher than it was before.
- Update the Saves of any Attributes you increased.

## Skill, Trade, & Language Points

Check your Player Character Progression Table and see if you gain any Skill Points or Trade Points.

- If you do, spend them to increase your Mastery Levels and increase those modifiers.

**DC Tip:** Remember not to exceed the 'Mastery Limit' depending on what level you are. Level 5 is Adept, Level 10 is Expert, Level 15 is Master, and Level 20 is Grandmaster.

## Health

These are the categories that you could gain HP in:

- Check your Class Table for additional HP.
- If you increase your Might Attribute, then you also increase your HP by 1 for each point of Might you gain.
- You could possibly gain an Ancestry Trait or other Talent that grants an HP bonus. .

## Defense

**PD:** When you increase your Agility or Intelligence, increase your PD by an equal amount.

**AD:** When you increase your Might or Charisma, increase your AD by an equal amount.

<!-- image -->

## Talents

PCs gain Talents at specific Levels (as shown in their Class Tables) to improve their statistics or to gain new abilities.

## Talent Requirements

If a Talent has a requirement (such as a Level requirement), you must meet that requirement to choose that Talent. A Talent may be taken multiple times, unless otherwise stated.

**DC Tip:** The GM might also award Talents at key story moments or as rewards. Keep in mind that these can be quite powerful, especially at early levels.

## Multiclass Talents

Multiclass Talents allow you to gain Features from other Classes, except Flavor Features (see Class Flavor Features below). Some Multiclass Talents also allow you to gain Subclass Features, which can be from any Class (including your own). You can't gain the same Feature more than once.

**Class Flavor Features:** Once you gain 2 Class Features from the same Class, you automatically gain that Class's Flavor Feature.

**Example:** If a Wizard gains 2 Barbarian Features, they automatically gain the Barbarian's Flavor Feature: Shattering Force.

**Specific Damage Types:** When you gain a Feature that references a damage type of a different Feature, you use that same damage type. If there are multiple choices of damage types to choose from, you must choose one when you gain the Feature.

**Example:** The Cleric Feature: Channel Divinity has an option (Censure Divine) that deals “Divine Damage” to nearby creatures of your choice. The Cleric normally choose their type of Divine Damage at level 1 when they gain the Cleric Order Feature. If a Champion uses a Multiclassing Talent to gain the Channel Divinity Feature, they would need to choose a type of Divine Damage listed in the Cleric Order Feature.

## Novice Multiclass

**Example:** If a Champion chooses the Martial Path at level 2, they gain +1 SP, +1 Maneuver, and +1 Technique. If that Champion chose Spellcaster Path instead, they would gain +2 MP, +1 Cantrip, and +1 Spell.

## CHAPTER 5: Ancestries

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Ancestry System

During character creation you must choose your character's **Ancestry**, which represents the physical form your character takes in the world, such as Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling and Gnome. Each Ancestry has a list of **Ancestry Traits**, which you can gain by spending **Ancestry Points**.

## Ancestry Traits

Ancestry Traits give your character physiological properties or abilities based on your Ancestry. You can choose various combinations of Ancestry Traits to customize your character to express the type of fantasy race you want to play.

## Ancestry Points

Ancestry Points can be spent to gain Ancestry Traits. Most Traits cost between 1 and 3 Points, however, some Traits have a Point value of 0 or lower: **Minor Traits** and **Negative Traits**.

## Gaining Ancestry Points

When first creating your character, you have 5 Ancestry Points. You gain 2 additional Ancestry Points when you reach Level 4, and again when you reach Level 7.

## Types of Ancestry Traits

Each Ancestry has 4 kinds of Ancestry Traits.

## Minor Ancestry Traits

These Traits cost 0 Ancestry Points and provide minor benefits that are respective of each Ancestry's unique abilities and origins. You can only choose 1 Minor Trait.

## Negative Ancestry Traits

These are Traits that have a negative Point value due to a penalty it gives your Character. These give you additional Ancestry Points equal to the negative value of the Trait.

**Example:** If you choose the Negative Trait Reckless (-1), then you would gain the Trait (which reduces your PD by 1) and also gain 1 Ancestry Point (since the value of the Trait is worth -1). After this, you would technically have 6 total Ancestry Points to spend, but you would still end with a total of 5 (6 -1).

## Default Ancestry Traits

These are a set of pre-defined Ancestry Traits that are worth a total 5 Ancestry Points. These include a Minor Trait and may also include a Negative Trait.

**DC Tip:** This is perfect for new players! They can just say, 'I want to be an Elf,' and get the pre-made list of the Elf Default Traits and be done with this step of Character Creation.

## Expanded Ancestry Traits

These are optional Ancestry Traits that you can choose from to customize your Character's Ancestry for either mechanical or flavor reasons.

**DC Tip:** Some groups or GMs might choose to ignore these Expanded Ancestry Traits to speed up character creation (for new groups or for one shots) or to give a consistent feel to all Ancestries.

## Ancestry Origins

## Ancestry Flavor vs Mechanics

Player Characters are unique in this aspect, and with so many options you're able to create a wide variety of Ancestry Origins. You can customize them and make them your own, either for mechanical reasons or flavor/lore reasons.

## Ancestry Flavor

This is where you can say what your Character looks like based on their Ancestry. Maybe you choose Dwarf and Elf for your 2 Ancestries. Now you get to decide how they look, which has nothing to do with game mechanics. Maybe you're a tall slender elf with a huge beard, maybe you're a thick stocky dwarf with smooth hairless skin and pointy ears, or maybe you look completely like a Dwarf and all of those 'Elven Traits' are more recessive and aren't represented visually. You might have the EYES of an elf, but everything else looks Dwarvish.

**DC Tip:** Maybe you love the Mechanics of a Gnome, but you really want to play a Halfling. Talk to your GM about if it's ok to completely separate the mechanics of your character from what you visually look like. Work together and brainstorm how your Halfling Character gained the mechanics of a Gnome (through magic, through practice, or etc.).

If you wanted to play a Dwarf that had a backstory of being from a long line of Dwarves, you totally can! Pick Dwarf and then ask yourself, 'How else do I want to express my Character?' If you're going to be a Cleric, then maybe look into the Angelborn Traits. If you want to play a brave Dwarf, then maybe look into the Halfling (they have a Halfling Bravery Trait). This doesn't mean that you are that Ancestry, or that one of your parents were, it's just a way to further express your character and let them have the Traits that best fit them.

**DC Tip:** If your ideal Dwarf possess Traits only included in the Giantborn Ancestry list, pick some of those Traits for your 'Dwarf' so you can create the character you have in mind. You can describe your Mixed Ancestry character as being a specific kind of Dwarf or a Dwarf/Giantborn hybrid. You can express your Ancestry however you wish.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Ancestry Mechanics

This is where you choose your Ancestries based on the game mechanics of what Ancestry Traits they offer. Build out your character accordingly and then step back and see what your character would look like. I had a player make a character that just wanted to make a BIG Barbarian, so he chose Giantborn and Orc. I asked him what that looks like, and we talked about it and decided that he was going to be an 'Ogre-born' which ended up being a really cool enhancement to his backstory... even though his choices were based on game mechanics.

## Ancestry Appearance

The appearance of this new Ancestry is for the PC and GM to come up with together (also making sure it fits into the lore of the setting). The Ancestry could look similar to an already existing Ancestry but be magically different for other reasons. The Ancestry could be an entirely new species that you want to bring into the world, mixing and matching Traits around to get the exact right feel for your PC.

**DC Tip:** How I have always handled this is that the visual aspect of a character is completely up to the player, then the Ancestry Points take care of the 'balance' and the mechanics of what that Ancestry can do.

## Ancestry Lore & Flavor

Each Ancestry has unique biological and cultural pieces that can combine with Backgrounds to create very unique PCs.

- Unique Biology Facts
- Ancestry Quirks Table
- Names List
- Ancestries' Cultures

This will be available at the release of the full game. The Beta is focused on the mechanics of the game, so the flavor and lore will be revealed in the future.

## Ancestry Creation

Every character starts with the Base Ancestry Traits below, and their Ancestry gives them a list of additional Traits they can spend their 5 Ancestry Points on.

## Base Ancestry Traits

- **Size:** Your Size is Medium.
- **Speed:** You have a Speed of 5 Spaces.
- **Creature Type:** Your Creature Type is Humanoid.

## Choose Your Ancestry

Pick 1 or 2 Ancestries to show where your character comes from, what they look like, or how they perform mechanically. This usually represents what Ancestry your character's parents were. When you select an Ancestry, you gain access to its Ancestry Traits List (Default and Expanded).

## Starting With 1 Ancestry

You gain access to its Ancestry List. You can choose a second Ancestry any time you gain additional Ancestry Points.

**DC Tip:** This does give you less options during Character Creation, but gives you more flexibility to choose a second Ancestry at a later time as the direction you take your character evolves.

## Starting With 2 Ancestries

You gain access to both Ancestry Lists of each chosen Ancestry.

**DC Tip:** This gives you more options during character creation, but somewhat less flexibility at higher levels when you gain additional Ancestry Points.

## Spend Your Ancestry Points

You have 5 Ancestry Points to spend on any Ancestry Traits from among your Ancestry Trait Lists. Your Ancestry needs to have a total of 5 Ancestry Points worth of Traits (including negative Traits). You can choose multiple Negative Traits, but you can only choose 1 Minor Trait. You must spend all your Ancestry points during character creation (you can't save them for later).

## Gaining & Losing Negative Traits

You can't gain more than 2 Ancestry Points total from your Negative Ancestry Traits. You can remove Negative Ancestry Traits at higher Levels by spending 1 Ancestry Point if their cost is (-1) or 2 Ancestry Points if their cost is (-2).

<!-- image -->

## Duplicate Ancestry Traits

You can't choose a Trait of the same name multiple times, unless it says otherwise.

**Example:** A PC chooses Dwarf and Giantborn as their 2 Ancestries. The Tough Ancestry Trait is available to both Ancestries. The PC could only choose the Tough Ancestry Trait once, even though it's available to both Ancestries.

## Ancestry Trait Requirements

If an Ancestry Trait has a requirement, such as a Level requirement, then you must meet that requirement to choose that Ancestry Trait.

## Attribute & Mastery

## Increases

Certain Ancestry Traits grant increases to Attributes, Skills, and Trades. These Ancestry Traits can't exceed the Attribute Limit, Skill Mastery Limit, or Trade Mastery Limit, unless they say otherwise.

## Refunding Ancestry Traits

If you gain a Talent or Feature that grants you a benefit that's identical to (or a better version of) an Ancestry Trait you have, you can choose to immediately replace that Ancestry Trait with 1 or more other Ancestry Traits available to you that are worth the same amount of Ancestry Points.

**Example 1:** A Dwarf with the Natural Combatant Ancestry Trait (grants Mastery with Heavy Armor and all Shields) uses their 2nd Level Talent to pick the Martial Expansion Talent (grants Mastery with all Weapons, Armors, and Shields), then the Dwarf would be refunded the Ancestry Points they spent to gain Natural Combatant and would need to immediately use those Points to gain a different Ancestry Trait available to them.

**Example 2:** If you have an Ancestry Trait that grants you Water Breathing and Swim Speed, then later you gain a Class Feature that ONLY grants a Swim Speed (but not Water Breathing), that would NOT count and you wouldn't get any Ancestry Points refunded to you (you would keep both). If you later get another feature that ONLY grants Water Breathing, you could then get a refund for the Ancestry Trait since you would have other Features or Talents granting you the exact same (or better) abilities.

**DC Tip:** There might be a scenario where a Minor Trait is replaced by a Feature or Talent. In this case a GM could allow a Player to pick another Minor Trait from another Ancestry (if it would make sense for that PC).

## Variant Rules

## Custom Ancestries

If you want to give your PC a personalized Ancestry or you want to combine 3 or more Ancestries together, you can create a Custom Ancestry. This gives Characters access to ALL Ancestry Lists at once but only gets 4 points to spend instead of 5. All other Ancestry Creation Rules still apply. When you gain Ancestry Points, you can spend them on any Ancestry List of your choice.

**DC Tip:** You could also choose to let PCs get the full 5 Ancestry Points for their Custom Ancestry, but keep in mind that this would be VERY strong and the default option for most everyone at the table (for both min-maxing and roleplay reasons). If you're ok with this, then let them have the full 5 Points instead of 4.

## Variable Negativity

This Variant Rule allows you to gain Negative Ancestry Traits when you gain Ancestry Points after Character Creation. You still can't gain more than 2 Ancestry Points total from your Negative Ancestry Traits at a time.

## Stronger or Weaker Ancestries

Game Masters can choose to start the game off with higher or lower Ancestry Point totals (instead of 5).

**Lower Points:** If you want less power to come from Ancestries, and want it to be more of a subtle thing they get, you can lower the Ancestry Point total down to 4, 3, or 2. The player would have to choose which Ancestry Traits they get to use to equal that total for that character.

**Higher Points:** If you want to give your players more power and customization at the start of the game, you can give them more Ancestry Points to build a stronger Ancestry with.

**DC Tip:** I would be very careful with this. The game is balanced around PCs getting 5 points, so there could be some very powerful combinations players could take advantage of.

## Ancestry Adoption

This option allows you to select one Ancestry Trait from any Ancestry available, then follow the rules as written for spending the rest of your Ancestry Points.

**DC Tip:** You could be making this choice for tactical combat reasons, roleplay reasons, or anything in between. Talk to your GM (and even the rest of your party) to show what unique twist you've added to your PC.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Ancestry 'Magic Items'

This option allows you to 'think outside the box' on why your PC can do what they can do and where they got their 'powers' from. With this rule, you can choose from any of the Ancestry Traits and give yourself a 'magic item' that represents that power. You can do this multiple times for multiple points worth of traits. You can tie all these points into a single item or into multiple items.

**Example:** You want to play a 'normal' Human PC, but you REALLY want to have a Breath Weapon (from the Dragonborn Ancestry) and don't want to say that you're part Dragonborn. You can create a Human with 3 points spent in the Human Ancestry, then with the other 2 points you can get the Dragonborn's Breath Weapon but describe that it comes from a 'magic ring' on your finger. This allows you to play the fantasy of a human while still having the magical abilities that you want.

**DC Tip:** I've done this myself with Class Features before. I had a PC who was a complete commoner, but he happened to find a magic sword. As soon as he picked it up he was granted the powers of a Spellblade. If I ever lost the sword, then those powers were gone. It's a very unique way to make a unique PC.

## GM and PC Notes

Keep in mind that this 'feature' is now being represented by an object that's not part of the PC. This means that it could be stolen or possibly work differently if the PCs go to an area that nullifies the effects of magic items (making the item stop working). So have an open dialogue with each other about this and how it might look at your table.

## CHAPTER 6: Classes

A protective Barbarian could tap into their power if their friends are in danger. A frightened Barbarian could lash out when they're scared.

**DC Tip:** Or of course an ANGRY Barbarian might want to smash everything in sight!

## Bard

Bards utilize artistic expression through various forms to connect with the emotions and heart of magic. This includes a wide range of mediums such as musical instruments, singing, dancing, drawing, painting, sculpting, poetry, storytelling, inspirational speech, and more. They are great at bringing the best out in those around them through both helping and performing, showcasing high proficiency across multiple disciplines. Bards are remarkably flexible and adaptable spellcasters, capable of tapping into a wide array of magical abilities with the appropriate artistic expression.

**Source of Power:** Bards derive their power from harnessing their emotions and force of will, as well as those of others around them. The feeling you get when listening to a stirring song, hearing masterfully read poetry, or witnessing a captivating performance that gives you chills, elevates your heart rate, and provokes you to dance, that passion is what fuels their potential. A Bard's emotion, determination, and willpower flows through their unique artistic expression, touching the hearts and minds of those around them and bringing their magic to life.

**Bard Flavor:** Bards compile a repertoire of artistic expressions that they manifest as Spells. Musician Bards utilize specific songs or instruments to cast Spells, while dancer Bards perform particular dance moves that represent different Spells. Storyteller Bards initiate combat by narrating tales of wonder and adventure, seamlessly weaving Spells into key points of the story. Painter Bards fluidly and freely paint images, each triggering a specific Spell.

For example, a group of commoners' Charisma Save would probably only be a +1 or so. If there were also important NPCs within the crowd, then they could roll for those individually.

A response of Unclear could come from the deity not knowing the answer, wanting to purposefully keep it a secret, the question being phrased in a confusing or complicated way, or there not being a simple answer to the question.

## Wild Form

You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to transform into a Wild Form of your choice. You can spend 1 AP on your turn to shift back and forth between your True Form and any Wild Forms you currently have available. Once per Long Rest, you can transform without spending MP or using MP enhancements.

## True Form

When you transform from your Wild Form to your True Form, your statistics return to normal. You immediately revert to your True Form when your Wild Form HP is reduced to 0 or you die.

## Wild Form

When you transform into a Wild Form, you gain the Wild Form's current Wild Form HP (see Wild Form HP below), retaining any HP losses.

- **Duration:** Each Wild Form remains available until its Wild Form HP is reduced to 0 or you complete a Long Rest.
- **Multiple Forms:** You can have multiple Wild Forms available at a time which have their own Wild Form HP and Traits.

## Statistics

While in your Wild Form, you're subjected to the following changes (unless otherwise stated):

- **Stat Block:** You use the Wild Form Stat Block below to determine your statistics.
- **Identity:** You maintain your personality, intellect, and ability to speak.
- **Wild Form HP:** You gain a secondary pool of Wild Form Health Points, which is 3 with a maximum of 3. Damage and healing effects target your Wild Form HP before your True Form HP, and any excess damage or healing carries over to your own HP.

When you use this Feature, you can spend additional MP (up to your Mana Spend Limit) to gain 2 additional Trait Points per MP spent.

## Wild Form Stat Block

Small or Medium Beast (your choice)

| HP | 3 | AP | Same |
|---|---|---|---|
| PD | 8+CM+PM | PDR | 0 |
| AD | 8+CM+PM | MDR | 0 |
| Speed | 5 | Masteries | Same |
| Prime | Same | Save DC | Same |
| MIG | 1 | CHA | Same |
| AGI | 1 | INT | Same |

**DC Tip:** Shapeshifting presents a unique problem for players, since they can have Mastery in something that's physically difficult or even impossible for them. Fish don't pick locks and slugs can't intimidate, but maybe a monkey can. Consider changing DCs for Checks in some animal forms.

## Wild Speech (Flavor)

You learn the Druidcraft Cantrip and can choose 1 of the following options:

- **Animals:** You can understand and speak with Beasts in a limited manner. You can understand the meaning of their movements, sounds, and behaviors, and they can understand the meanings of simple words, concepts, and emotions.
- **Plants:** You can understand and speak with Plants in a limited manner. You can understand the meaning of their swaying, folding, unfolding of their leaves and flowers, and they can understand the meanings of simple words, concepts, and emotions.
- **Weather:** You can reach out to nature and cast the **Commune with Nature** Spell as a Ritual once per Long Rest.

## Wild Speech Sidebar

One thing to keep in mind with communicating with plants and animals is that they have a very different worldview than people.

## Communicating with Animals

**The World:** An animal might know a lot about the region it lives in, such as local sources of food and water, the presence of other animals, and the location of roads and shelters of nearby savage and civilized societies.

**Other Inhabitants:** An animal might only recognize the existence of creatures as prey (deer, sheep, and rabbits) and predators (bears, tigers, and wolves).

**Quirks:** If asked a question, an animal would respond with words rather than sentences, such as 'cold', 'hungry', 'scared', and 'safe'. They are instinctual creatures that operate on emotion.

## Communicating with Plants

**The World:** A plant might not be able to conceive the possibility of other locations, and may describe creatures as having appeared then disappeared with no notion of where they came from or went to.

**Other Inhabitants:** A plant might only recognize the existence of creatures as friends (bees, birds, and frogs) and enemies (rabbits, deer, and lumberjacks).

**Passing of Time:** A seedling might consider a recent event something that happened a moment ago and an ancient event something that happened yesterday. An ancient oak tree might consider a recent event something that happened 10 years ago, and an ancient event something over 100 years.

**Expertise:** A plant may be able to describe in keen detail the different kinds of rains, storms, quality of soil, and various local bugs and herbivores.

This allows you to leave simple messages such as 'Safety', 'Threat', or 'Wealth', or mark the location of a cache, a secret passageway, a safehouse, or an area of danger.

**DC Tip:** This could be anything from the slang of the slums, to the fancy language of the upper classes. It could even be more specific as some kind of bizarre double speak between twin siblings or between the political elite. If the Player doesn't know what to choose for this, they can always defer to a generic thieves guild option.

## Sorcerer

Sorcerers tap into the raw magic in their own bodies as a conduit to harness, manipulate, and sculpt magic with wild resolve. They can overload themselves and even cast Spells without Mana, pushing the limits of magic and their own bodies.

**Source of Power:** A Sorcerer's magic is in their blood, allowing them to tap into it naturally and use it in ways others can't. This could come from a lineage of angels, dragons, demons, or something else.

- Their own bloodline or connections to the past.
- Their careful study and practice of both swords and spells.
- They take up their blade in honor of a deity, cause, or goal.

## Spellstrike

Once on each of your turns when you make a Martial Attack, you can also cast a Spell as part of the same Action, spending 1 AP less than normal.

**Converged Action:** When you do, the Spell can only target 1 creature who must be a target of the Attack, and the range of the Attack can't exceed the range of the Spell. The Spell uses the Attack Check as its Spell Check for any of its requirements, and any Saves you force the target to make are made against your Save DC.

**Harmonic Strike:** The Attack and Spell from a Spellstrike are treated as 1 Attack, and can benefit from Maneuvers and Spell Enhancements. The Spell doesn't require Somatic Components.

**DC Tip:** Because it's treated as 1 Attack, the damage from the Attack and Spell benefit from Critical Hits, Heavy Hits, and beyond only once.

**Example 1:** A Spellblade makes a Weapon Attack using a Shortsword (1 Slashing damage) as part of the Attack Action. They choose to use Spellstrike, which lets them also cast a Spell as part of the same Action. They choose the Firebolt Spell (2 Fire damage). Normally the Spell costs 1 AP to cast, but now costs 0 AP (since Spellstrike reduces its cost by 1). On a Hit, the Spellstrike deals 3 total damage (1 Slashing and 2 Fire).

**Extended Example 1:** The same Spellblade from Example 1 can add even more to their Spellstrike, by spending AP to perform Attack or Save Maneuvers or to add the Firebolt Spell's AP Enhancement options. You can also spend SP to use Smite or perform additional Maneuvers.

## Warlock

Warlocks make a pact with a powerful entity that grants them magic. Their body and soul are a part of this contract and as such, they can tap into their own life force to enhance and amplify their magic and capabilities as well as drain the life force of other living creatures. They also choose a type of pact to be made that grants more powers.

**Source of Power:** Warlocks gain their power through a pact with a powerful entity. By making a deal with this entity (and following the conditions), they gain access to magic that they can channel as their own. Unlike a Cleric (who believes in, follows, and has a true relationship with their deity), Warlocks simply make a deal and have more of a transactional or business relationship with their patron. Pacts can be made with all sorts of entities of all ranges of power levels as well, such as gods, devils, fey creatures, otherworldly beings, dragons, and even other powerful Warlocks.

**Warlock Flavor:** A Warlock pact could be made by choice or by force, could be demanding or simple, and could be made with a good, neutral, or evil entity (which might be unknown by the Warlock). The Character might have to accomplish certain tasks in order to keep their powers, or the entity might take a more passive role and not ask much from them.

You could pick 4 Spell Schools and then grab Spells from across all the Prepared Lists if you want to, but it will be difficult without with the current number of Spells.

## CHAPTER 7: Spell Lists

## Premade Spell Lists

These are premade and curated Spell Lists that different Classes can choose from. This is designed to be a placeholder for the FULL Spell Lists that were described in the Spellcasting section of the rules and in the Spellcasting Classes Mastery Features.

How this works right now is that you pick Spells from your Spell List based on how many your Class Table allows you to get.

The following Spells are placeholders for the Spells that'll be released later. These are iconic Spells that you should recognize and were chosen to feel familiar as you learn how to play DC20 RPG. These will be updated and expanded upon in new and exciting directions, but we wanted to make sure you can see the basics of what Spells will look and feel like.
