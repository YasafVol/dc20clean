# CHAPTER 1: Core Rules

## Attributes & Prime Modifier

## Attributes

There are 4 Attributes in DC20 that represent your Physical (Might & Agility) and Mental (Intelligence & Charisma) abilities. Each Attribute has a value that ranges from -2 to +7 (for most creatures) which measures your aptitude with that Attribute.

- **Might** = your Strength of Body.
- **Agility** = your Balance, Nimbleness, and Dexterity.
- **Charisma** = your Charm, Presence, Persuasiveness, and Force of Will.
- **Intelligence** = your Reasoning, Understanding, and Wisdom.

**Example:** If you have an Agility of 3, then you would add +3 to any d20 roll that uses Agility.

## Might

This represents your physical strength, health, and endurance. It's commonly associated with the following:

- Your Might is added to your Area Defense.
- Your Might is added to your maximum Health Points.
- Checks made to Initiate or Escape Grapples use Athletics (Might) Checks.
- Might contributes to lifting, pushing, dragging, throwing, and encumbrance.
- Might Saves are made to resist effects that push you away, knock you down, or crush you.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay a PC that is the 'go to' for being the strong one and overpowering your enemies, then Might is for YOU!

## Agility

This represents your avoidance, dexterity, and finesse. It's commonly associated with the following:

- Your Agility is added to your Precision Defense.
- Agility contributes to your Initiative Check.
- Checks made to Escape Grapples use Acrobatics (Agility) Checks.
- Agility contributes to jumping and reducing damage taken from falling.
- Agility Saves are made to resist effects that reduce your Speed, cause you to lose your balance, or can be avoided by dodging out of the way.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay a PC that is nimble, light on their feet, and good with their hands, then Agility is for YOU!

## Charisma

This represents your charm, presence, and force of will. Anything related to interacting socially with other creatures (your appearance, mannerisms, and the words you say) is Charisma. It's commonly associated with the following:

- Your Charisma is added to your Area Defense.
- Charisma can contribute to Language Checks made to understand languages you have limited fluency with.
- You gain a number of Grit Points equal to your Charisma + 2.
- Social Skill Checks use Charisma, such as the Skills to Influence other creatures or to gain Insights into their actions or behaviors.
- Charisma Saves are made to resist effects that attempt to alter your emotions or dominate your will.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay as the 'face of the party' and have good people skills, then Charisma is for YOU!

## Intelligence

This represents your reasoning, understanding, and wisdom. Anything that is related to a person's intellectual capacity or overall knowledge falls under Intelligence. It's commonly associated with the following:

- Your Intelligence is added to your Precision Defense.
- Intelligence can contribute to Language Checks made to understand languages you have limited fluency with.
- You gain a number of bonus Skill Points to spend on more Skills.
- Knowledge Trade Checks use Intelligence, such as the knowledge of Engineering, Nature, Religion, Occultism, History, or Magic (Arcana).
- Intelligence Saves are made to resist effects that attempt to read your thoughts, alter your memories, confuse you, or use illusions to deceive your senses.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay a PC that is the smartest person in the room and just knows things, then Intelligence is for YOU!

## Starting Attributes

You get your PC Attributes from one of the following methods and then assign the values to each of the 4 Attributes.

## Standard Method

You start with an array of 3, 1, 0, -2 and assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain 2 additional Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

## Point Buy

You start with a -2 in all of your Attributes. You then gain 12 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**DC Tip:** Your Prime Modifier (see later in this chapter) comes from your highest Attribute, so it's a good idea to make sure that you get a 3 in at least one of your Attributes.

## Roll Method

You determine your starting values by rolling 1d6-3 four times, and then assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain +2 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**Prime Modifier Insurance:** If the value of your highest Attribute is less than 3 (even after adding the +2 Attribute Points), you can reduce a different Attribute value by 1 or more to increase your highest Attribute by the same amount. You can't reduce an Attribute value below -2 or increase an Attribute above your Attribute Limit (3).

**DC Tip:** This method of determining your starting Attributes is the most risky. It offers the potential for the highest starting Attributes, but also the lowest. If you add all your Attributes together, their sum should be 4 (on average), after the +2 bonus points are added.

## Attribute Limit

You can increase your Attributes as you gain levels, however you can't increase an Attribute past the Attribute Limit. The Attribute Limit increases at certain levels as shown in the table below. You can increase an Attribute at the same level that your Attribute Limit increases.

| PC Level | Attribute Limit |
| :------- | :-------------- |
| 1        | +3              |
| 5        | +4              |
| 10       | +5              |
| 15       | +6              |
| 20       | +7              |

## Gaining Attribute Points

As your Player Character (PC) levels up they will regularly gain more Attribute Points to increase their Attributes. PCs gain +1 Attribute Point at levels 3, 5, 8, and 10.

**DC Tip:** You get more of these points beyond level 10 as well!

## Prime Modifier

Your Prime Modifier represents your overall experience and prowess as an adventurer. You use your Prime Modifier as the primary bonus you add to Checks involving attacking, casting a Spell, or overall awareness of dangers around you. Your Prime Modifier is commonly associated with the following:

- Attack Checks (made to Attack with a Weapon or Unarmed Strike).
- Spell Checks (made to cast a Spell or use a supernatural ability).
- Save DCs (the difficulty of resisting the effects you impose on other creatures).
- Awareness Checks (your ability to perceive and detect things around you).

**DC Tip:** The Barbarian in the group having a high Charisma instead of Might doesn't make him worse at swinging a sword.

## Prime Modifier Value

Your value of your Prime Modifier is always equal to the value of your highest Attribute. If your highest Attribute changes, your Prime Modifier derives its value from the value of your new highest Attribute. Your Prime Modifier is not an Attribute, nor considered the Attribute that it derives its value from.

**Example:** If Might is your highest Attribute, then your Prime Modifier derives its value from the value of your Might. If your Might is 3, then your Prime Modifier is 3. If an effect grants you ADV on Might Checks, it does not also grant you ADV on Checks that use your Prime Modifier (such as Attack Checks and Spell Checks) unless the effect otherwise says so.

## Variant Rules

## Prime Modifier Equals Attribute Limit

Instead of Prime Modifier being determined by a PC's highest Attribute, it's instead equal to their Attribute Limit. This means it will always be 'maxed out', no matter where you put your Attributes Points. This rule is designed for Players who want to create a PC that's more well-rounded and doesn't have one or two main Attributes they lean heavily on. This rule allows for Players to have more freedom in character creation, because their Prime Modifier will always start at 3 and progress with their level.

**DC Tip:** Be aware that if everyone in the group builds a balanced PC, then no one in the group will be the go to for certain activities or skills. This can ruin the nuanced group dynamics that TTRPG parties are often designed around, where every PC feels like they have a strong purpose that's supported by mechanical advantages and not just narrative choices. If you like to have groups in which each PC gets their moments in the spotlight, then this might not be a rule for you.

## Prime Modifier Sidebar

The Prime Modifier allows you to create the kind of character you truly want to play without negatively impacting their combat prowess. Since your Prime Modifier will be used to swing weapons and cast Spells, this allows you to choose which Attribute you want to be the highest without feeling forced into picking a specific one. An Intelligent or Charismatic Barbarian may not have as much health or be able to grapple or lift as much as a Might Barbarian, but your ability to wield a weapon is the same.

You can choose whether you roleplay the source of which Attribute your Prime Modifier comes from in Combat or not. It's up to you. You could describe your intelligent Barbarian as being a tactical mastermind on the battlefield, or your charismatic Barbarian as a fiery confident leader, or you can be a mindless rage monster in Combat if you want to just smash things. This is an opportunity to create the PC you want.

## Skills

Skills are representative of a creature's ability to perform certain activities. If two creatures are wrestling each other, they can use the Athletics Skill to compete against each other. Every Skill is tied to an Attribute (Might, Agility, Intelligence, or Charisma). Each Skill represents an aspect of an Attribute, such as Athletics being an aspect of a creature's Might Attribute, or Acrobatics with its Agility Attribute. The Awareness Skill uses your Prime Attribute, which is your highest Attribute.

**DC Tip:** There are countless ways to use these Skills, especially when you use the 'Variable Attribute Rule' (see Checks and Saves section). You can really get outside the box by combining Skill with different Attributes.

**DC Tip:** The Knowledge Trades don't have Tools listed because they're Trades that only involve the recalling or teaching of information.

## Trade Attributes

Every Trade is tied to an Attribute. The Attribute represents what might be needed to perform this Trade, such as the use of one's own strength (Might), intricate hand movements (Agility), knowledge and understanding (Intelligence), or interactions with others (Charisma).

**Variant Attributes:** There are ways that you might use other Attributes in alternative combinations for Trades in unique circumstances. A theater performer might use Charisma to capture the hearts of their audience with an emotional performance, Agility to perform a fast-paced dance, Might to throw a theater partner into the air, or Intelligence to remember the lines of a detailed monologue. PCs can work with their GM to determine which Attribute might fit best in these unique situations. The list of Trades below includes the Attributes most commonly used with each respective Trade.

## Gaining Mastery

You can gain Mastery from your Class, Class Features, Subclass Features, Ancestry Traits, or Talents. You'll have opportunities at character creation and when your PC levels up to select a variety of options to gain any of the above Mastery Types.

## Skill Mastery

Skill Mastery represents your proficiency with a Skill. There are several Skill Mastery Levels, ranging from Novice to Grandmaster. Each increasing Level of Skill Mastery grants greater bonuses to the Skill Checks in which you have Mastery (see Skills for more information on the different Skills).

## Skill Mastery Levels & Limits

There are 5 Skill Mastery Levels. Each Skill Mastery Level grants you a +2 bonus on the respective Skill Checks. Your Skill Mastery Limit starts at Novice and increases based on your Character Level as shown in the table below.

| Character Level | Mastery Limit | Mastery Bonus |
| :-------------- | :------------ | :------------ |
| 1               | Novice        | +2            |
| 5               | Adept         | +4            |
| 10              | Expert        | +6            |
| 15              | Master        | +8            |
| 20              | Grandmaster   | +10           |

**Example 1:** If you have 2 Skill Mastery Levels in the Athletics Skill (Adept), you add a +4 bonus (+2 per Level) to any Athletics Check you make. See Checks & Saves for more information on making Skill Checks.

**Example 2:** If a PC has a Skill Mastery Limit of Adept, they can allocate up to 2 Skill Points into a single Skill, such as the Awareness Skill. If that PC has additional Skill Points to allocate, they can't allocate them into the Awareness Skill until their Skill Mastery Limit increases to Expert or higher.

## Gaining Skill Mastery

You can increase your Skill Mastery Level from Skill Points or from certain Traits, Features, or Talents.

## Skill Mastery Level Increases

You can gain Skill Mastery directly through Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents.

- **Class Skills:** Some Classes (such as Hunter) grant Skill Mastery based on chosen Feature options.
- **Ancestry Skills:** Some Ancestries (such as Humans) grant Skill Mastery.

## Skill Points

You can spend Skill Points to increase your Skill Mastery Level in a given Skill, up to your Skill Mastery Limit. You gain Skill Points from your Background, Class, Intelligence, and possibly from Talents you choose.

- **Background Skills:** Your Background grants you 5 Skill Points.
- **Class Skills:** All Classes grant additional Skill Points based on your Level.
- **Talent Skills:** Some Talents (such as Skill Increase) grant additional Skill Points.
- **Intelligence Skills:** You gain a number of Skill Points equal to your Intelligence. If your Intelligence is negative, then your total Skill Points is reduced by the same amount. If your Intelligence changes, your total Skill Points change by an equal amount.

## Increasing Your Skill Mastery Limit

Some Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents can increase your Skill Mastery Limit. A Skill can only benefit from 1 bonus to its Skill Mastery Limit at a time. When your Skill Mastery Limit increases at the normal level, it continues to be benefit from the bonus to its Skill Mastery Limit.

**Example 1:** The Skill Mastery Limit of a Level 1 PC is Novice. If that PC is a Human, they can take the Human Ancestry Trait: Skill Expertise, which increases the Skill Mastery Limit of 1 Skill of their choice. If they choose the Awareness Skill, the Skill Mastery Limit of the Awareness raises from Novice to Adept. If that PC gains another Trait, Feature, or Talent that increases their Skill Mastery Limit, then Awareness won't benefit from it because it's Skill Mastery Limit has already been increased beyond its normal level.

**Example 2:** A Level 1 PC has a Skill Mastery Limit of Novice. If it gains a bonus to its Skill Mastery Limit (such as through the Roguish Finesse Feature), it's Skill Mastery Limit increases to Adept. When its Skill Mastery Increases normally at Level 5, its Skill Mastery Limit increases to Expert.

## Skill Points to Increase Skill Mastery Limit

You can increase your Skill Mastery using Skill Points. Choose a Skill. You can spend 1 Skill Point to increase its Skill Mastery Limit by 1. You must still spend another Skill Point to increase its Skill Mastery Level to meet the new Limit.

**Example:** A Bard spends 1 Skill Point to get Novice Skill Mastery in the Influence Skill. Then they spend 1 Skill Point to increase their Skill Mastery Limit in Influence from Novice to Adept and an additional Skill Point to increase their Skill Mastery Level in Influence also to Adept. In total, they spent 3 Skill Points to raise their Skill Mastery Level with the Influence Skill from having no Skill Mastery to now having Adept Skill Mastery.

## Lacking Skill Mastery

When you make a Skill Check using a Skill in which you lack Mastery, you don't gain a Skill Mastery bonus on the Check.

**DC Tip:** Certain abilities might require a certain level of Mastery to perform, or other passive abilities might be granted to those of different Mastery Levels. There are a lot of possibilities here.

## Trade Mastery

Trade Mastery represents your proficiency with a Trade. There are several Trade Mastery Levels, ranging from Novice to Grandmaster. Each increasing Level of Trade Mastery grants greater bonuses to the Trade Checks in which you have Mastery (see Trades for more information on the different Trades).

## Trade Mastery Levels & Limits

There are 5 Trade Mastery Levels. Each Trade Mastery Level grants you a +2 bonus on the respective Skill Checks. Your Trade Mastery Limit starts at Novice and increases based on your Character Level as shown in the table below.

| Character Level | Mastery Limit | Mastery Bonus |
| :-------------- | :------------ | :------------ |
| 1               | Novice        | +2            |
| 5               | Adept         | +4            |
| 10              | Expert        | +6            |
| 15              | Master        | +8            |
| 20              | Grandmaster   | +10           |

**Example 1:** If you have 3 Trade Mastery Levels in the Alchemy Trade (Expert), you add a +6 bonus (+2 per Level) to any Alchemy Check you make. See 'Checks & Saves' on page 24 for more information on making Trade Checks.

**Example 2:** If a PC has a Trade Mastery Limit of Adept, they can allocate up to 2 Trade Points into a single Trade, such as the Cartography Trade. If that PC has additional Trade Points to allocate, they can't allocate them into the Cartography Trade until their Trade Mastery Limit increases to Expert or higher.

## Gaining Trade Mastery

You can increase your Trade Mastery Level from Trade Points or from certain Traits, Features, or Talents.

## Trade Mastery Level Increases

You can gain Trade Mastery directly through Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents.

- **Ancestry Trades:** Some Ancestries (such as Humans) grant Mastery with specific Trades.

## Trade Points

- **Background Trades:** Your Background grants you 3 Trade Points.
- **Class Trades:** All Classes grant additional Trade Points based on your Level.
- **Talent Trades:** Some Talents (such as Trade Increase) grant additional Trade Points.

## Converting Skill Points to Trade Points

You can convert 1 Skill Point into 2 Trade Points (but not the other way around).

## Increasing Your Trade Mastery Limit

Some Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents can increase your Trade Mastery Limit. A Trade can only benefit from 1 bonus to its Trade Mastery Limit at a time. When your Trade Mastery Limit increases at the normal level, it continues to be benefit from the bonus to its Trade Mastery Limit.

**Example 1:** The Trade Mastery Limit of a Level 1 PC is Novice. If that PC is a Human, they can take the Human Ancestry Trait: Trade Expertise, which increases the Trade Mastery Limit of 1 Trade of their choice. If they choose the Gaming Trade, the Trade Mastery Limit of the Gaming Trade raises from Novice to Adept. If that PC gains another Trait, Feature, or Talent that increases their Trade Mastery Limit, then Gaming won't benefit from it because it's Trade Mastery Limit has already been increased beyond its normal level.

**Example 2:** A Level 1 PC has a Trade Mastery Limit of Novice. If it gains a bonus to its Trade Mastery Limit (such as through the Trade Expertise Ancestry Trait), it's Trade Mastery Limit increases to Adept. When its Trade Mastery Increases normally at Level 5, its Trade Mastery Limit increases to Expert.

## Trade Points to Increase Trade Mastery Limit

You can increase your Trade Mastery using Trade Points. Choose a Trade you do not have Mastery in, you can spend 1 Trade Point to increase its Trade Mastery Limit by 1. You must still spend another Trade Point to increase its Trade Mastery Level to meet the new Limit.

**Example:** A Champion spends 1 Trade Point to get Novice Trade Mastery in the Blacksmithing Trade. Then they spend 1 Trade Point to increase their Trade Mastery Limit in Blacksmithing to Adept and an additional Trade Point to increase their Trade Mastery Level in Blacksmithing also to Adept. In total, they spent 3 Trade Points to raise their Trade Mastery Level with the Blacksmithing Trade from having no Trade Mastery to Adept Trade Mastery.

## Lacking Trade Mastery

When you make a Trade Check using a Trade in which you lack Mastery, you don't gain a Trade Mastery bonus on the Check. Some Trade Checks might be harder to perform or not possible at all if you don't have the tools needed or if you're using some kind of improvised tools.

**DC Tip:** Certain abilities might require a certain level of Mastery to perform, or other passive abilities might be granted to those of different Mastery Levels. There are a lot of possibilities here.

## Language Mastery

Language Mastery represents your fluency with a Language. There are only 2 Language Mastery Levels: Limited and Fluent. See Languages for more information on the different Languages.

## Language Mastery Levels

You can spend Trade Points (see Trade Mastery above) to increase your Language Mastery Level in a given Language, up to the maximum Language Mastery Level of 2 (Fluent).

| Mastery Level | Language Fluency                                                                         |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-None        | You don't know the language.                                                             |
| 1-Limited     | You can read, write, and speak, but you must make a Language Check and succeed to do so. |
| 2-Fluent      | You can read, write, and speak fluently.                                                 |

**Example:** If you have 1 level of Language Mastery (Limited) in the Goblin Language, you can make a Language Check to attempt to read, write, speak, or understand the Goblin Language. Alternatively, 2 levels of Language Mastery (Fluent) would allow you to do so without needing to make a Check. See 'Checks & Saves' on page 24 for more information on making Language Checks.

**DC Tip:** In this system, there's more of a progression to learning a language and there are more subtle interactions that happen both from a roleplay standpoint and a mechanics standpoint.

## Language Mastery Limit

There's no Mastery Limit for Languages. You can use Language Points to increase your Language Mastery in as many Languages as there are available to you.

## Gaining Language Mastery

You are Fluent in Common. You can gain additional Language Mastery using Language Points.

## Language Points

You gain Language Points from your Background, and possibly from Talents you choose.

- **Background Languages:** Your Background grants you Common Fluency and 2 Language Points.
- **Talent Languages:** Some Talents (such as Trade Increase) grant additional Trade Points, which you can convert to Language Points (see below).

## Converting Trade Points to Language Points

You can convert 1 Trade Point into 2 Language Points (but not the other way around).

**DC Tip:** Because 1 Skill Point can be converted into 2 Trades Points, this means that 1 Skill Point can effectively be turned into 4 Language Points.

## Lacking Language Mastery

If you don't have Language Mastery with a Language, you can't read, write, speak or understand it.

## Combat Mastery

Combat Mastery represents your experience in dealing with dangers and overcoming adversaries in Combat. You have Combat Mastery with the following:

- Attack Checks and Spell Checks
- Precision Defense and Area Defense
- Attribute Saves and Save DC

**DC Tip:** You don't have Combat Mastery with Death Saves, so those Saves don't add your CM.

### Combat Mastery Formula

1/2 your Character's Level (rounded up)

## Combat Training

Combat Training represents your proficiency with using equipment effectively in Combat. You can gain Combat Training with the following types of equipment: Weapons, Armor, and Shields.

## Gaining Combat Training

Martial Classes grant Weapon Training.

All Classes grant you Armor Training. Some Classes (such as the Champion), Ancestry Traits (such as Natural Combatant), or Talents (such as Martial Expansion) grant you Weapon or Shield Training.

## Lacking Combat Training

You suffer the following penalties while wearing or wielding the following equipment that you lack Training with:

- **Weapons:** While wielding a Weapon in which you lack Combat Training, you can't use its Weapon Enhancement.
- **Spell Focuses:** While wielding a Spell Focus in which you lack Combat Training, you don't benefit from its properties.
- **Armor:** While wearing Armor in which you lack Combat Training, you have DisADV on Attack Checks and Spell Checks.
- **Shields:** While wielding a Shield in which you lack Training, you have DisADV on Attack Checks and Spell Checks.

## Checks & Saves

Whenever an attempt is made by a creature to perform an action that has a chance of success and failure, they make a Check or a Save to determine the outcome of the attempt. The type of action the creature is attempting to perform determines whether they make a Check or a Save. When a creature makes a Check or Save, they roll a d20 and add any relevant bonuses which are determined by the type of Check or Save.

**Checks:** When a PC initiates an action against another creature or obstacle, the GM might ask them to make a Check to determine if the activity is successful. The GM might also ask for a Check to be made when two or more creatures are engaging in a competition of skill against each other.

**Saves:** When a PC reacts against an effect being forced upon them, the GM might ask them to make a Save to determine if they're successful at resisting the effect.

**Example:** A Might Check would be to see if you can lift the heavy boulder that's just sitting there, while a Might Save would be to see is you can stop a heavy boulder that's rolling down a hill at you!

**Willing Creatures:** Any creature can choose to fail a Check or Save. When they do, treat the result of their Check or Save as a 0 for the purposes of degrees of success or failure (see 'Check & Save Outcomes' on page 31), but the creature doesn't suffer the effects of a Critical Failure unless they choose to do so.

## Types of Checks

There are several types of Checks a GM might ask a creature to make, such as an Attack Check when making an Attack, a Spell Check when casting certain Spells, a Martial Check when performing certain Maneuvers, a specific Skill Check when performing a test of skill, a specific Trade Check when performing a test of professional expertise, or a specific Flat Attribute Check performing a test of aptitude that doesn't benefit from skill or expertise.

**Flat Attribute Checks:** When a creature attempts to perform an activity that doesn't benefit from Mastery, they make a certain type of Flat Attribute Check, such as a Flat Might Check to lift a very heavy object or a Flat Intelligence Check to remember a conversation they once had.

**Attack Checks:** When a creature attempts to hit a target with an Attack, they make an Attack Check to determine if their Attack hits the target.

**Martial Checks:** When a creature attempts to perform a Maneuver that isn't an Attack, they make a Martial Check to determine its potency.

**Spell Checks:** When a creature casts a Spell that isn't an Attack, they make a Spell Check to determine its potency.

**Skill Checks:** When a creature attempts a test of skill, they might perform a Skill Check, such as an Influence Check to determine how convincing your argument is, or a Trickery Check to determine if you can pocket an item without being noticed. See the 'Skills' on page 12 for more information.

**Trade Checks:** When a creature attempts a test of professional expertise, they might perform a Trade Check, such as a Blacksmithing Check to determine the result of their efforts crafting a Weapon, or a Theater Check to determine how well an audience responds to their performance. See the 'Trades List' on page 15 for more information.

**Language Checks:** These are used to see how well you can read, write, or speak using a language you have Limited Language Mastery in. You add your Charisma or Intelligence (your choice) to these Checks.

## Types of Saves

A creature can make a Save to resist an effect imposed against it by another creature, a trap, or aan environmental hazard. The type of effect will determine which type of Save the creature makes: Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence.

**Might Saves:** Resist effects that push you away, knock you down, or crush you.

**Agility Saves:** Resist effects that cause you to lose your balance or that can be avoided by successfully dodging out of the way.

**Charisma Saves:** Resist effects that attempt to dominate your mind or alter your emotions.

**Intelligence Saves:** Resist effects that attempt to read your thoughts, alter your memories, confuse you, or use illusions to deceive your senses.

## Checks

## Flat Attribute Checks

When a creature performs a task that doesn't benefit from Mastery, it makes a Flat Attribute Check (Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence). To make a Flat Attribute Check, roll a d20 and add the associated Attribute to the result.

### Flat Attribute Check Formula

d20 + Attribute

**Example:** A GM might ask a PC to make a Flat Agility Check to see how flexible they are or a Flat Charisma Check to determine the first impression they make upon entering a room. If the PC's Charisma is 4, they roll a d20 and add 4 to the result.

## Attack Checks

A creature can make an Attack Check when it makes an Attack. When a creature makes an Attack Check, it rolls a d20 then adds its Prime Modifier and Combat Mastery to determine the result.

### Attack Check Formula

d20 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery

**Example:** A Level 4 Barbarian's highest Attribute is a 3 (Prime Modifier) and their Combat Mastery is 2 (1/2 its level). When the Barbarian makes an Attack Check, they roll a d20 and add 5 (2+3). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result of the Attack Check is 15 (10 + 5).

## Spell Checks

A creature can make a Spell Check when it takes the Spell Action to cast a Spell that isn't an Attack or uses a Feature that calls for one. When a creature makes a Spell Check, it rolls a d20, then adds its Prime Modifier and Combat Mastery to determine the result.

### Spell Check Formula

d20 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery

**Example:** A Level 6 Wizard's highest Attribute is 4 (Prime Modifier) and has a Combat Mastery of 3 (1/2 its level). When the Wizard makes a Spell Check, they roll a d20 and add 7 (4+3). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result of the Spell Check is 17 (10 + 7).

**DC Tip:** Spell Checks are most often used when Casting a Spell (see 'Spellcaster Chapter' on page 59 for more information). Spell Checks are made against Spell DCs or Saves.

## Martial Checks

A creature can make a Martial Check when it uses a Maneuver that isn't an Attack or uses a Feature that calls for one. When a creature makes a Martial Check, it rolls a d20, then adds its Prime Modifier and Combat Mastery to determine the result.

### Martial Check Formula

d20 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery

**Example:** A Level 7 Champion's highest Attribute is 4 (Prime Modifier) and has a Combat Mastery of 4 (1/2 its level). When the Champion makes a Martial Check, they roll a d20 and add 8 (4+4). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result of the Martial Check is 18 (10 + 8).

**DC Tip:** Martial Checks are most often used when performing a Maneuver (see 'Maneuvers' on page 49 for more information). Martial Checks are made against Checks or Saves.

## Skill Checks

When a creature attempts a test of skill, the GM might have them make a Skill Check to determine whether they succeed or fail. The GM will choose the Skill to use with the Check based on the activity attempted.

## Making a Skill Check

To make a Skill Check, a creature rolls a d20, adds their Skill Mastery in the given Skill (if any), and adds the Attribute associated with the Skill. The result of the Skill Check is compared to the DC set by the GM. If the result of the Skill Check is equal to or higher than the DC, then the Check is successful.

### Skill Check Formula

d20 + Attribute + Skill Mastery

**Example:** A Level 4 Hunter's Agility Attribute is 3 and their Skill Mastery in Stealth is Novice (+2). When the Hunter makes a Stealth Check to attempt to avoid being detected by other creatures, they roll a d20 and add 5 (3+2) to the result.

**DC Tip:** Each Skill has a Base Attribute that is the 'default' Attribute you would use for a given Check.

## Trade Checks

When a creature attempts a test of professional expertise, the GM might have them make a Trade Check to determine whether they succeed or fail. The GM will choose the Trade to use with the Check based on the activity attempted.

## Making a Trade Check

To make a Trade Check, a creature rolls a d20, adds their Trade Mastery in the given Trade (if any), and adds the Attribute associated with the Trade. The result of the Trade Check is compared to the DC set by the GM. If the result of the Trade Check is equal to or higher than the DC, then the Check is successful.

### Trade Check Formula

d20 + Attribute + Trade Mastery

**Example:** A Level 5 Artificer's Might Attribute is a 4 and their Trade Mastery in Blacksmithing is Adept (+4). When the Artificer makes a Blacksmithing Check to attempt to use Blacksmithing Tools to forge something, they roll a d20 and add 8 (4+4) to the result.

## Trade Tools

A creature must use the specified Trade Tools when attempting a Trade Check (see 'Trades' on page 15 for more information on Trade Tools). If a creature attempts a Trade Check using tools not designed for the task (such as using a hair pin instead of Lockpicking Tools to pick a lock), they have Disadvantage on the Trade Check.

## Language Checks

When you are trying to read, write, or speak in a language you have Limited Language Mastery in, you can make a Language Check to do so. Roll a d20 and add your Charisma or Intelligence (your choice).

### Language Check Formula

d20 + (Intelligence or Charisma)

**Language Check DC:** The DC of a Language Check is determined by the type of language. DC 10 for Mortal, DC 15 for Exotic and Divine, and DC 20 for Outer.

**DC Tip:** The GM will set a DC based on how hard it would be to read, write, or speak that language. The Halfling language would be easier to understand than Deep Speech for example.

## Special Checks

## Check Contests

When a creature makes a Check against an opposing creature's Check (or Save), they are engaged in a Contest. The creature with the highest Check result is the winner of the Contest. If a Contest results in a tie, then the situation remains unchanged.

**Example:** A Barbarian attempts to push a Rogue. If the Barbarian's Check is higher than the Rogue's Check, then the Rogue is pushed. If the Barbarian's Check is lower than the Rogue's Check, then the Rogue is not pushed. If the Barbarian's Check is equal to the Rogue's Check, then the Rogue is not pushed.

## Check Categories

Checks are organized into categories, such as: Attribute Checks, Physical Checks, Mental Checks, and Martial Checks. Some Checks fall within multiple Check Categories.

### Attribute Checks

An Attribute Check includes any Check that uses an Attribute, such as:

**Might Checks:** Flat Might Checks, Athletics Checks, and Intimidation Checks.

**Agility Checks:** Flat Agility Checks, Acrobatics Checks, Trickery Checks, and Stealth Checks.

**Charisma Checks:** Flat Charisma Checks, Animal Checks, Influence Checks, and Insight Checks.

**Intelligence Checks:** Flat Intelligence Checks, Investigation Checks, Medicine Checks, and Survival Checks.

### Physical Checks

A Physical Check includes any Check that requires a creature's physicality to perform, such as Might Checks, Agility Checks, and Martial Checks.

### Mental Checks

A Mental Check includes any Check that requires a creature's focus to perform, such as Charisma Checks, Intelligence Checks, and Spell Checks.

## Passive Skills

Sometimes a GM might not ask a PC to roll any dice to determine the success of a Check. Instead, the GM would use the PC's average result for that type of Check. Every Skill has a Passive value, such as Passive Awareness, Passive Insight, and Passive Athletics. The value of a Passive Skill is equal to 10 + all bonuses normally applied to its Check.

**DC Tip:** These Passive Skills are used when the PC is not actively performing this action or it's being done over a longer period of time. This number represents their 'Average' ability at each Check.

### Passive Skill Formula

10 + All Bonuses

**Example:** A Level 1 Champion has 2 Levels of Mastery (+4 bonus) in Awareness, and its highest Attribute is 3 (Prime Attribute). Normally it would make an Awareness Check by rolling a d20 and adding 7 (4+3) to the Check, however its Passive Awareness would instead by 17 (10+7). If a Rogue attempts to sneak by the Champion (while they aren't actively looking), the Rogue would have to succeed a DC 17 Stealth Check to avoid being detected.

## Permanent ADV and DisADV

If you have an effect that grants you a permanent ADV or DisADV to a Skill Check, then you add (ADV) or subtract (DisADV) 2 to your Passive Skill for each instance of ADV or DisADV.

**Example:** The Commander has Heavy Armor and has DisADV on all Stealth Checks they make. Since this is a permanent effect (as long as they're wearing that armor), you would also subtract 2 from the Commander's Passive Stealth Skill.

## Saves

Many Saves in DC20 target one of a creature's 4 Attributes Saves (Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence).

## Attribute Saves

When a creature is subjected to an effect, they make the an Attribute Save to determine whether or not they're able to resist the effect. The Attribute used to make the Save is determined by the effect (or the GM).

## Making an Attribute Save

The creature rolls a d20, adds its given Attribute, and adds its Combat Mastery. If the result of the Attribute Save is equal to or higher than the Contested Check, the Attribute Save is successful.

### Attribute Save Formula

d20 + Attribute + Combat Mastery

**Example (Might Save):** A level 2 Barbarian that attempts to resist being pushed against their will would make a Might Save to prevent themselves from moving. Their Might is 3 and their Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) is 1, so their total bonus to the Save is a 4. They would roll a d20 and add 4 to their Might Save.

**Example (Agility Save):** A level 5 Rogue that attempts to jump to safety when the ground beneath their feet collapses would make an Agility Save to secure its footing on solid ground. Their Agility is 4 and their Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) is 3, so their total bonus to the Save is a 7. They would roll a d20 and add 7 to their Agility Save.

**Example (Charisma Save):** A level 10 Bard that attempts to resist being mind controlled would make a Charisma Save to retain control over their own actions. Their Charisma is 5 and their Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) is 5, so their total bonus to the Save is a 10. They would roll a d20 and add 10 to their Charisma Save.

**Example (Intelligence Save):** A level 16 Wizard that attempts to break free of illusions that grip their senses would make an Intelligence Save to discern what's real and what isn't. Their Intelligence is 6 and their Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) is 8, so their total bonus to the Save is a 14. They would roll a d20 and add 14 to their Intelligence Save.

## Special Saves

## Death Saves

When a creature makes a Death Save, it rolls a d20. If the result is 10 or higher it succeeds on its Death Save. See 'Death's Door' on page 35 for more information on Death Saves.

## Save Categories

Some Saves are organized into categories, such as Physical Saves, Mental Saves, and Death Saves.

**Physical Saves:** When an effect targets your overall physical abilities, you make a Physical Save. Your Physical Save bonus is equal to your Might Save bonus or Agility Save bonus, whichever is higher.

**Example:** A creature that attempts to resist gaining Exhaustion from a Spell that withers its body would make a Physical Save to avoid suffering any effects.

**Mental Saves:** When an effect targets your overall mental abilities, you make a Mental Save. Your Mental Save bonus is equal to your Charisma Save bonus or Intelligence Save bonus, whichever is higher.

**Example:** A creature that attempts to resist being teleported against its will would make a Mental Save to remain in the same location.

## Save DC

Your Save DC represents the difficulty a creature would have to resist your static effects (such as Traps) and ongoing effects (such as Spells). Every creature has a Save DC, which is equal to 10 + its Prime Modifier + its Combat Mastery.

### Save DC Formula

10 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery

**Repeated Saves:** When a creature fails a Save against an effect that has the Repeated Save statement, it can repeat its Save at the end of each of its turns. When that happens, the creature repeats its Save against a Save DC (instead of the original opposing Check).

**Example:** A Giant Snake targets a Barbarian with a Melee Attack that causes the target to become Restrained. The Giant Snake makes an Attack Check that's Contested by the Barbarian's Physical Save. If the Barbarian fails its Save against the effect it becomes Restrained. However, the Barbarian can repeat its Save at the end of each of its turns to free itself from being Restrained. When it repeats its Save it does so against the Giant Snake's Save DC.

## Dynamic Attack Saves

Some game features (such as a Maneuvers, Techniques, Spells, etc.) both deal damage and impose an effect on its target. This triggers what is called a Dynamic Attack Save.

The provoking creature makes an Attack Check (or Spell Check) at the same time that the target makes its Save. The provoking creature's Check is compared against the target's Defense to determine if the target takes damage, and the target's Save is compared against the provoking creature's Save DC to determine if the target is subjected to the effect.

### Dynamic Attack Save Outcomes

A Dynamic Attack Save can result in 1 of 4 outcomes:

- **Attack Hit & Save Failure:** The target takes damage and is subjected to the effect.
- **Attack Miss & Save Failure:** The target does not take damage but is subjected to the effect.
- **Attack Hit & Save Success:** The target takes damage but is not subjected to the effect.
- **Attack Miss & Save Success:** The target does not take damage and is not subjected to the effect.

**DC Tip:** There are many game features that both deal damage and impose an effect on its target. When this happens, an Attack Check or Spell Check is ALWAYS made to determine DAMAGE while a Save is ALWAYS made against the EFFECT. This opens up many very interesting interactions on what the outcome will be and keeps things moving quickly because both the Attacker and the Target make these rolls at the same time (similar to how Contested Checks work). With Dynamic Attack Saves, you don't have to wait for the Attack Check to hit, then have the target make a Save, they both happen at the same time.

## Check vs Defense, Save, or DC

## Check vs Defense (Damage Only)

Actions that attempt to deal damage, requires you to make an Attack Check against the target's Defense to determine whether or not the Attack hits the target. This type of Action is called an Attack (see 'Attacks' on page 33 for more information). The Action's description will state whether the Attack Check is made against the target's PD or AD (see 'Defenses' on page 34 for more information). If the result of the Attack Check is equal to or greater than the target's Defense, then the Attack hits.

## Check vs Save (Effect Only)

Actions that attempt to impose an effect on a creature (such as a Condition) require you to make a Check (such as a Martial Check or Spell Check) against the target's Save. If the result of the Check is greater than the target's Save, the target becomes subjected to the effect. Depending on the Failure Statements of the Save, failing the Save by 5 or more may impose additional penalties on the target (see 'Degrees of Failure' on page 32 for more information).

## Check vs DC

Actions that target you or your allies require you to make a Check (such as a Martial Check or Spell Check) against the Action's own DC to determine success or failure. Depending on the Success Statements of the Action, exceeding the DC by 5 or more may grant additional benefits (see 'Degrees of Success' on page 32 for more information).

## Dynamic Attack Save (Damage & Effect)

Some Actions attempt to deal damage and impose a Condition on the target (see 'Dynamic Attack Saves' on page 28 for more information). These Actions require you to make an Attack Check against the target's Defense, and require the target to make a Save against your Save DC. The Attack determines if the Action deals damage to the target, and the target's Save determines if they're subjected to the effects of the Action.

## Managing Multiples

## Making Multiple Saves

Some Actions force the target to make a Save against your Save DC to avoid suffering a stated effect. If a creature is forced to make a Save against multiple effects that are a part of the same Action, the target only makes 1 Save of each type that's imposed by the Action.

**Example:** A Sorcerer casts a powerful Spell against an enemy that includes 3 different types of effects that require Saves. 2 of the effects require a Mental Save each, and 1 effect requires a Charisma Save. The target makes 1 Mental Save for both of the Mental Save effects, and 1 Charisma Save for the other effect.

## Targeting Multiple Creatures

If an Action you perform targets more than 1 creature, or includes more than 1 in an Area of Effect (such as an Arc, Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere), then you make 1 Check (such as an Attack Check, Martial Check, or Spell Check) against all creatures.

**Example:** If a PC makes an Attack that targets an area which includes 4 creatures, the PC would make 1 Attack Check and compare it to the Defense of each creature in the area.

## Competing Effects

If you try to impose an effect on a target already under a similar one (such as opposing telekinesis or mind control), the GM may call for a contested Check between you and the effect's source (such as an opposing spellcaster or an enchanted object).

**DC Tip:** The GM decides when two effects are similar enough to compete with each other, so they decide when a contest is necessary.

**Contest:** Make a contested Spell Check against the opposing source. If your effect already requires a Spell Check, use that result for the contest. Success: Your effect takes hold as the existing effect ends. Failure or Tie: Your effect fails, and the existing effect remains.

**Example:** A Vampire has charmed a noble with its mind control. A Spellcaster casts a a similar mind controlling Spell, attempting to wrest the noble's mind away from the vampire's control. The Spell Check the Spellcaster makes to cast their Spell is contested against a Spell Check the Vampire makes. If the result of the Spellcaster's Check is higher than the Vampire's Check, then the noble is now under the Spellcaster's mind control instead of the Vampire's.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

When a creature has Advantage (ADV) on a Check or Save, it rolls two d20 and takes the highest number rolled across both dice. If the creature has Disadvantage (DisADV) instead, it takes the lowest number across both dice.

**Example:** A creature has ADV on a Check. Normally it would roll a single d20 when making the Check, but because it has ADV it rolls two d20 instead and takes the highest number rolled.

### Gaining Advantage

When a creature makes a Check or Save in Combat, it can spend 1 or more AP to gain ADV on its Check or Save per AP spent.

**Example:** A Barbarian chooses to make an Attack with a Greatmaul against a creature. The Barbarian can spend 1 AP to grant themselves ADV on their Attack Check.

**DC Tip:** DCs are designed primarily to be used outside of Combat. Since creatures can spend AP to gain ADV in Combat, the GM can replace the normal DC with the Encounter DC to reflect the difficulty of attempting the task during Combat. See the 'Starting Combat' on page 115 for more information.

### Stacking ADV or DisADV

Sometimes a creature might have multiple sources of ADV (or DisADV) on a single Check or Save.

**ADV X:** If a creature has multiple instances of ADV on a Check or Save, it has ADV X where X represents the number of additional dice the creature rolls when making the Check or Save. The creature rolls 1 additional d20 for each ADV it has on the Check or Save, and takes the highest number across all dice.

**Example:** A creature has ADV 2 on a Check. It rolls a d20 plus 2 additional d20 (3 total dice) and takes the highest number rolled across all of the dice.

**DisADV X:** If a creature has multiple instances of DisADV on a Check or Save, it has DisADV X where X represents the number of additional dice the creature rolls when making the Check or Save. The creature rolls 1 additional d20 for each DisADV it has on the Check or Save, and takes the lowest number across all dice.

**Example:** A creature has DisADV 3 on a Check. It rolls a d20 plus 3 additional d20 (4 total dice) and takes the lowest number rolled across all of the dice.

**DC Tip:** ADV 1 and DisADV 1 is the same thing as 'regular' ADV and DisADV. When rolling a d20 to make a Check or Save, the 1 just represents the 1 additional d20 you're rolling, which is what happens with regular ADV and DisADV. Most of the time they'll simply be referred to as ADV and DisADV.

## Combining ADV & DisADV

If a creature has both ADV and DisADV at the same time, each instance cancels out. If they all cancel out, the creature makes a standard d20 roll as usual. If there are any remaining ADV or DisADV, then it makes the roll with whatever ADV (or DisADV) is left over.

**Example 1:** If a creature had both ADV and DisADV then that would become a standard roll of a single d20. If you had DisADV 3 and also had ADV, then one of the ADV would cancel out one of the DisADV and you would be left with DisADV 2.

**Example 2:** If a creature has both DisADV 3 and and ADV 2 on a Check, two of the ADV cancel out two of the DisADV, leaving only one DisADV remaining. The Check is then made with DisADV 1, which is just regular DisADV (rolling 2 dice and taking the lower number).

**DC Tip:** Basically just subtract any ADV or DisADV from each other and see what you are left with, and if the answer is ever 0, then you just make a standard d20 roll.

## Variable ADV & DisADV

Gaining ADV and DisADV on Checks made against other creatures is very common. Sometimes you might have to make a Check against a group of creatures where you have ADV or DisADV on the Check against some of the targets but not all of them. When that happens, follow these steps below:

1.  Make a Check against all targets you don't have ADV or DisADV against by rolling a single d20 and adding any relevant bonuses you have on the Check against the targets.
2.  For any additional targets you have ADV or DisADV against, roll a second d20 and compare it to the first d20 you already rolled. For all targets you have ADV against, choose the higher number rolled, and for DisADV choose the lower number rolled.
3.  If you have ADV/DisADV 2 or higher against any additional targets, repeat Step 2 for each additional dice you have to roll until you resolve the outcome of your Check against all targets.

**Example:** A Wizard targets 3 creatures with a Fireball Spell. It doesn't have ADV against the first target (rolls 1d20), has ADV against the second target (rolls 2d20), and ADV 2 against the third target (rolls 3d20). The Wizard rolls a d20 and uses it to determine the outcome of its Spell Check against the first target. It then rolls another d20 and compares it to the first d20 (total of 2d20s) to determine the outcome of its Spell Check against the second target. It then rolls another d20 and compares it to the first 2 d20s (total of 3d20s) to determine the outcome of its Spell Check against the third target.

## Multiple Check Penalty

During Combat, each time a creature makes the same Check before the end of its turn, they suffer stacking DisADV on that type of Check, such as specific Flat Attribute Checks (Flat Might, Flat Agility, Flat Charisma, Flat Intelligence), Attack Checks, Spell Checks, and specific Skill Checks (Stealth, Athletics, Influence, etc.), and specific Trade Checks (Theatre, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, etc.). This penalty only applies to Checks made during the creature's turn, and doesn't apply to Reactions taken on another creature's turn (unless otherwise stated).

- **1st Attempt:** Normal roll.
- **2nd Attempt:** DisADV 1 (roll 2 dice and take the lowest result).
- **3rd Attempt:** DisADV 2 (roll 3 dice and take the lowest result).
- **4th Attempt:** DisADV 3 (roll 4 dice and take the lowest result).

**Example:** If a creature casts a Spell by making a Spell Check, its first attempt would be a normal roll, but subsequent Spell Checks would have stacking DisADV (as shown above).

**DC Tip:** The Multiple Check Penalty does not apply outside of Combat.

**Multiple Action Penalties:** Some Actions have penalties when you take it multiple times, such as the Help Action. These penalties count as the Multiple Check Penalty for the purposes of game mechanics that apply to Multiple Check Penalties.

## Check & Save Outcomes

## Critical Success & Failure

When a creature rolls a 20 on a d20, the Check or Save gains a Critical Success. When a creature rolls a 1 on a d20, the Check or Save suffers a Critical Failure. A Critical Success or Critical Failure can affect the outcome in different ways, as determined by the type of Check or Save being made.

## Attack, Martial, and Spell Checks

### Critical Success

**Damage:** When a creature gains a Critical Success on an Attack, Martial, or Spell Check that deals damage, the Attack is considered a Critical Hit (automatically hits and deals +2 damage).

**Effect:** When a creature gains a Critical Success on an Attack, Martial, or Spell Check that doesn't deal damage, the Check automatically succeeds even if the result would normally fail.

### Critical Failure

When a creature gains a Critical Failure on an Attack, Martial, or Spell Check, it becomes Exposed against the next Attack made against it before the start of its next turn. They also suffer additional penalties depending on if the Check deals damage or not.

**DC Tip:** For Critical Failures, the GM could change the Condition to Hindered (your next Attack Check has DisADV) instead of Exposed at their discretion.

**Damage:** When a creature suffers a Critical Failure on an Attack, Martial, or Spell Check that deals damage, the Attack automatically misses even if the result would normally hit.

**Effect:** When a creature gains a Critical Failure on an Attack, Martial, or Spell Check that doesn't deal damage, the Check automatically fails even if the result would normally succeed.

## Saves, Skill Checks, & Trade Checks

### Critical Success

When a creature gains a Critical Success on a Save, Skill Check, or Trade Check, the Check or Save automatically succeeds even if the result would normally fail.

### Critical Failure

When a creature suffers a Critical Failure on a Save, Skill Check, or Trade Check, the Check or Save automatically fails even if the result would normally succeed.

**DC Tip:** The GM should avoid asking PCs to make Checks where success shouldn't be possible. If a PC ties a heavy chain around a building, it shouldn't be possible for them to succeed on a Might Check to drag the building. Conversely, the GM should avoid asking PCs to make Checks where failure shouldn't be possible, like asking a PC to make a Might Check pick up a pebble. Unless the circumstances introduce the possibility of success or failure, try to refrain from asking for Checks for activities that are impossible to succeed or fail. Mistakes are going to happen and GMs might ask for a roll when they shouldn't have. The final outcome of a Critical Success or Critical Failure are up to the GM, and PCs should respect that.

### Contested Critical Outcomes

When multiple creatures gain a Critical Success in a contest (or all creatures suffer a Critical Failure), the creature with the highest total result wins the contest.

## Degrees of Success & Failure

## Degrees of Success

If a creature succeeds on a Check or Save by 5 or more, they may gain additional benefits beyond those of a normal success. The Check or Save will include a success statement, such as Success, Success (5), Success (10), or Success (each 5).

### Success

If the success statement says Success then the creature gains the listed benefits if the result of its Check or Save is equal to or higher than the opposing DC, Check, or Save.

### Success (each 5)

If a success statement says Success (each 5) then the creature gains the listed benefits for every 5 the result of its Check or Save is above the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Unless stated otherwise, the creature can gain the additional benefits multiple times.

**Example:** A Spell pushes a target back 3 Spaces on a successful Spell Check, but also includes the following success statement: 'Success (each 5): +1 Space.' That means that each 5 points the Spell Check is above the opposing DC, Check, or Save, the target is pushed 1 additional Space.

### Success (5) & Success (10)

If a success statement says Success (5) then the creature gains the listed benefits when they succeed by 5 or more above the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Moreover, if the success statement says Success (10) then they also gain the listed benefits when they succeed by 10 or more above the opposing DC, Check, or Save. This can continue on to Success (15) and further.

**Example:** A Spell increases a creature's Speed by 1 on a successful Spell Check, but has the following success statements: 'Success (5): Ignore Difficult Terrain,' and 'Success (10): Immune to Slowed.' That means that the creature's Speed is increased by 1 and ignores Difficult Terrain if its Spell Check is 5 above the Spell's DC, and the creature is also immune to the Slowed Condition if its Spell Check is 10 above the Spell's DC.

## Degrees of Failure

If a creature fails on a Check or Save by 5 or more, they may suffer additional penalties beyond those of a normal failure. The Check or Save will include a failure statement, such as Failure, Failure (5), Failure (10), or Failure (each 5).

### Failure

If a failure statement says Failure then the creature suffers the listed penalties if the result of its Check or Save is below than the opposing DC, Check, or Save.

### Failure (each 5)

If a failure statement says Failure (each 5) then the creature suffers the listed penalties for every 5 the result of its Check or Save is below the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Unless stated otherwise, the creature can suffer the additional penalties multiple times.

**Example:** A trap deals 4 Fire damage to a target on a failed Save, but also includes the following failure statement: 'Failure (each 5): +1 damage.' That means that each 5 points the Save is below the Trap's Save DC, the target takes an additional +1 Fire damage.

### Failure (5) & Failure (10)

If a failure statement says Failure (5) then the creature suffers the listed penalties when they fail by 5 or more below the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Moreover, if the failure statement says Failure (10) then they also suffer the listed penalties when they fail by 10 or more below the opposing DC, Check, or Save. This can continue on to Failure (15) and further.

**Example:** A Curse imposes the Blinded Condition on a failed Save, but has the following failure statements: 'Failure (5): Deafened,' and 'Failure (10): Doomed.' That means that the creature is both Blinded and Deafened if its Save is 5 below the Save DC, and the creature is also Doomed 1 if its Save is 10 below the Save DC.

## Attacks & Defenses

## Attacks

When a creature makes an Attack, it can do so by choosing a target within the Attack's Range (Melee, Ranged, or Area) and by making an Attack Check. How the Attack is resolved is determined by its Type and its Range.

## Attack Types

There are 2 types of Attacks: Martial and Spell.

### Martial Attacks

A creature makes a Martial Attack when they make an Attack Check using a Weapon or Unarmed Strike against a target's Defense.

**Unarmed Strike:** A Martial Attack made using any part of a creature's own body, such as a Punch, Elbow, Kick, Knee, or Headbutt.

**Weapon Attack:** A Martial Attack made using a Weapon, such as an Axe, Sword, or Bow. You can draw a Weapon as part of an Attack made using it.

### Spell Attacks

A creature makes a Spell Attack when they make an Attack Check using a Spell or similar ability (such as the Breath Weapon Trait from the Dragonborn Ancestry) against a target's Defense (see the 'Spellcaster Chapter' on page 59 for more information).

## Attack Ranges

Attacks have 3 types of ranges: Melee, Ranged, or Area.

### Melee Attack

A Melee Attack is an Attack with a range of Melee. A creature's Melee Range is 1 Space, unless otherwise stated.

### Ranged Attack

A Ranged Attack is an Attack with a range specified in a number Spaces (such as 10 Spaces). The Range is determined by the type of Weapon it's Attacking with or by consulting the ability used to make the Ranged Attack.

**Close Quarters:** You have DisADV on Ranged Attacks if you're within the Melee Range of at least 1 enemy, unless that enemy is Incapacitated (see the Disadvantage and Conditions sections for more information).

### Weapon Ranges

A Weapon that can be used to make a Ranged Attack has a Range shown in parentheses after its Ammo, Toss, or Thrown property (see 'Equipment' on page 133) for more information).

**Normal Range:** The first number in the parentheses is a Weapon's normal range. You can make an attack against any target within this range.

**Long Range:** The second number in the parentheses is a Weapon's long range. You can make an attack with DisADV against targets within this range. You can't make attacks against targets beyond your Weapon's long range.

**Example:** A Short Bow with a range of (15/45) means that it can be used to make attacks against targets between 1 and 15 Spaces, attacks with DisADV against targets between 16 and 45 Spaces, and can't attack targets that are 46 Spaces or farther away.

### Area Attack

A creature makes an Area Attack when they make an Attack against targets that are within a specified area (such as a Cone, Line, or Sphere) covered by the Attack. The type and size of the area is determined by the Attack.

**DC Tip:** The Close Quarters penalty doesn't apply to Area Attacks.

## Determining if an Attack Hits

When a creature makes an Attack, the result of the Attack Check is compared to the target's Defense to determine whether or not the Attack Hits the target. The Attack Hits if the result of the Attack Check is equal to or greater than the target's Defense.

**Example:** A Level 4 Champion's highest Attribute is a 3 (Prime Modifier) and their Combat Mastery is 2 (1/2 its level). When the Champion makes an Attack Check using a Longsword, they roll a d20 and add 5 (3 + 2). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result is 15 (10 + 5). If the target's PD is 15 or lower, the Attack Hits, otherwise it Misses.

## Defenses

When a creature makes an Attack to attempt to deal damage to a target, the creature's Check is compared against the value of one of the target's Defenses (Precision Defense or Area Defense) to determine if the Attack hits.

## Precision Defense

Precision Defense (PD) measures a creature's ability to avoid attacks that can be dodged, such as a precise strike or a ranged projectile. It reflects a combination of reflexes and tactical foresight, making it a crucial defense against single-target assaults.

## PD Calculation

Your PD is equal to 8 plus your Combat Mastery, Agility, and Intelligence. If you are wearing Armor or wielding a Shield (see 'Equipment' on page 133), you also add their respective bonuses to your PD.

- **Agility:** Represents your reaction speed and physical swiftness, allowing you to evade incoming attacks.
- **Intelligence:** Reflects your ability to anticipate danger and position yourself wisely, giving you the time needed to react.

### PD Formula

8 + Combat Mastery + Agility + Intelligence + Bonuses

## Area Defense

Area Defense (AD) measures a creature's ability to withstand attacks that can't be avoided, such as explosions, shockwaves, or other widespread effects. Instead of relying on dodging, Area Defense reflects raw endurance, resilience, and sheer force of will to endure the assault.

## AD Calculation

Your AD is equal to 8 plus your Combat Mastery, Might, and Charisma. If you are wearing Armor or wielding a Shield (see 'Equipment' on page 133), you also add their respective bonuses to your AD.

- **Might:** Represents your physical toughness and endurance, allowing you to absorb and resist bodily harm.
- **Charisma:** Reflects your inner resolve and commanding presence, reinforcing your ability to withstand mental and supernatural assaults.

### AD Formula

8 + Combat Mastery + Might + Charisma + Bonuses

## Health Points & Death's Door

## Health Points

Health Points (HP) are a game statistic representing a creature's ability to sustain damage. The stronger the creature the more HP it generally has, signifying the greater difficulty in defeating it.

**Example:** A Commoner has 4 HP, a Mastiff has 3 HP, a Cat has 2 HP and a Rat has 1 HP.

**DC Tip:** Most damage a creature takes is nonlethal—it just 'wears them down' until they get closer and closer to Death's Door. Lighter hits might graze you, while bigger hits knock you off your feet. The description and roleplay of how damage is taken can change depending on its source and the situation, but Health Points represent how much of a beating you can take before you die.

## Health Points at 1st Level

A PC has a number of Health Points equal to Class HP + Might. A PC might also gain additional HP from its Ancestry, such the Dwarf Trait Tough (+1 HP) or the Elf Trait Frail (-2 HP).

### Health Point Formula

Class HP + Might + Ancestry HP (if any)

**Example:** A PC picks the Champion Class at Level 1 and starts with a Might of 3 (the highest possible at Level 1). The Champion Class grants a base of 8 HP. The PC then adds +3 HP from their Might to get a total of 11 HP (8 + 3). If any of their Ancestry Traits increase or decrease their HP, they would add those to the total to determine their starting HP.

## Temporary Health Points

Temporary Health Points (Temp HP) are additional Health Points that persist for a limited duration. When you take damage, your Temp HP is reduced first, and then any remaining damage carries over to reduce your HP.

**Stacking:** Temp HP doesn't stack. If you gain Temp HP from different effects, you choose which effect to gain Temp HP from, and ignore the Temp HP granted by the other effects.

**Duration:** Temp HP lasts until you complete a Long Rest or its reduced to 0 by taking damage. An effect that grants Temp HP may state a shorter duration, such as 1 minute, until you complete a Quick Rest or Short Rest, or some other duration. When the duration expires, all Temp HP gained immediately vanish.

## Health Thresholds

Certain game mechanics affect creatures while their current HP is within certain thresholds. These HP thresholds are determined before any temporary changes to your HP maximum, such as from the Doomed Condition.

- **Bloodied:** HP is equal to or lower than 1/2 its maximum HP.
- **Well-Bloodied:** HP is equal to or lower than 1/4 its maximum HP.
- **Death's Door:** HP is equal to or lower than 0 HP, to a minimum of its Death Threshold.

A creature's Death Threshold is equal to 0 HP minus its Prime Modifier and its Combat Mastery.

**DC Tip:** If a creature is on Death's Door, they are still considered to be Bloodied and Well-Bloodied, because their HP is still below 1/2 their maximum (Bloodied) and 1/4 their maximum (Well-Bloodied).

**Example:** A creature with a maximum HP of 8 is considered Bloodied when its HP is 4 or lower, Well-Bloodied when its HP is 2 or lower, and on Death's Door when its HP is 0 or lower. If its Prime Modifier is 3 and its Combat Mastery is 1, the creature's Death Threshold is -4 HP. That creature dies if its HP is ever reduced to -4 HP or lower.

## Death's Door

When a PC is reduced to 0 HP they're on 'Death's Door' and fighting for their life. This is represented in whatever way the player wants to describe this state looks like for their character. They are NOT unconscious, they are in a heavily weakened state about to die if something is not done SOON! They could be prone crawling on the ground, holding themselves up with their sword, or spitting out blood as they hold on for dear life.

## Entering Death's Door

When you're reduced to 0 HP or lower, you gain Exhaustion 1. Until you are restored to 1 HP or higher, you suffer the following effects:

- **Action Point Limit:** Your current and maximum AP are reduced by 3.
- **Death Save:** You must make a DC 10 Death Save at the start of each of your turns.

**DC Tip:** You basically can only spend 1 AP per round of Combat, either on your turn or as a Reaction. This usually happens while on Death's Door.

## Death Saves

When a creature makes a Death Save, it rolls a d20 to determine if it Succeeds or Fails the Save.

### Success

- **Success:** No change.
- **Success (5):** You regain 1 HP.
- **Critical Success:** You are restored to 1 HP.

### Failure

- **Failure:** You gain Bleeding 1.
- **Failure (5):** You gain Bleeding 2 instead.
- **Critical Failure:** You also fall Unconscious until you're restored to 1 HP or higher.

**DC Tip:** If you are on Death's Door outside of Combat, you repeat the Death Save every 12 seconds instead (5 times per minute).

## Death's Door Sidebar

### Bleeding X (Condition)

You take X True damage at the start of each of your turns.

**Ending Bleeding:** All stacks of the Condition end when you're subjected to an effect that restores your HP. Alternatively, a creature can attempt to remove 1 or more stacks of the Condition by taking the Medicine Action.

### Medicine (Action)

You can spend 1 AP to touch a creature and tend to its wounds. Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. Success: You end 1 stack of Bleeding on the target. Success (each 5): You end an additional stack of Bleeding.

### First Aid Kit (Equipment)

You can spend 1 Charge and take the Object Action to treat a Bloodied creature's wounds (see First Aid Kit for more information). Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. Success: Target creature regains 1 HP. Success (each 5): The creature regains +1 HP.

## NPCs on Death's Door

Monsters and NPCs normally die when they're reduced to 0 HP, however the Game Master can choose to implement Death's Door on special enemies. They would drop down to 1 AP and be on Death's Door in that same weakened state, leaving a window for them to still talk to the party and get out any last words before someone puts them out of their misery.

## Damage

## Degrees of Damage

Each Attack has a base amount of damage that's dealt on a Hit. This value is listed alongside the Weapon (see 'Equipment' on page 133) or in the Spell's description (see 'Spellcaster Chapter' on page 59). If the Check beats the targets Defense by 5 or more, the target takes extra damage and may suffer additional effects (see 'Check & Save Outcomes' on page 31 for more information).

## Hit & Miss

When you make a Check against a target's Defense, the Check is considered a Miss if the result is below the target's Defense and it's considered a Hit if the result is equal to or above the target's Defense.

## Hit Success (each 5)

An Attack deals +1 additional damage for every 5 the result of the Check is above the target's Defense. If the result of the Check is 5 or more above the target's Defense, it is considered a Heavy Hit. If the result of the Check is 10 or more above the target's Defense, it is considered a Brutal Hit. Brutal Hits are considered Heavy Hits for purposes of effects that trigger on a Heavy Hit.

**DC Tip:** Heavy Hits are 5 over, Brutal Hits are 10 over, but if a Character ever manages to get 15 over a target's Defense I call this Beyond Brutal. Then I count by 5s to see how many instances of +1 bonus damage they get.

## Degrees of Damage Table

The table below shows how the damage of an Attack can change as determined by the result of the Check.

| Check vs Defense | Result     | Damage          |
| :--------------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| Lower            | Miss       | No Damage       |
| Equal or greater | Hit        | Base Damage     |
| +5 or greater    | Heavy Hit  | Base Damage + 1 |
| +10 or greater   | Brutal Hit | Base Damage + 2 |

## Critical Hits

When you roll a 20 on a d20 for an Attack, it's considered a Critical Hit. A Critical Hit automatically Hits the target, bypasses Damage Reduction, and deals an additional +2 damage.

**DC Tip:** An Attack can score a Critical Hit without the result of the Check being 5 or more above the target's Defense. When that happens, the Check is considered a Critical Hit and the target simply takes the base damage +2, however, this scenario is rare. A Critical Hit will normally result in a Check that's 5 or even 10 above the target's Defense, causing the target to take +2 damage from the Critical Hit plus +1 additional damage for every 5 the result is higher than its Defense.

## Damage Calculation Sidebar

This is a way for both Players and Game Masters to add up their damage in a way that's simple and quick. Once you Hit with an Attack, the GM will tell you if the Attack was a Heavy Hit or higher. This helps you determine how much additional damage your Attack deals (see the process shown below). The GM will apply any applicable Resistances or Vulnerabilities to determine the total amount of damage the target takes (see 'Bonus Damage' on page 38 for more on the target reducing damage).

### Adding Damage Order

Add up the damage totals in the following order:

1.  **Base Damage:** Start with the Base Damage of the Attack.
2.  **Heavy & Critical Hits:** Add any bonus damage from Critical Hits or Heavy Hits and higher.
3.  **Action Points:** Add any bonus damage from Action Points spent (Maneuvers, Class Features, AP Enhancements, etc.).
4.  **Situational Bonuses:** Add any bonus damage from situational bonuses (Class Features, Magic Items, etc.).

**DC Tip:** Starting with the Base Damage is a great foundation, and getting the Heavy Hit + out of the way first is nice. You'll get better at all the 'by 5's' math over time! Then you add any damage gained by spending AP, then any passives. This creates a great 'checkpoint' system for you to mentally navigate and keep things simple and quick.

**Example:** A Rogue attacks a beast with his Shortsword (we start off with a Base Damage of 1). They get a Brutal Hit and gain +2 bonus damage on their hit (1 + 2 = 3). They target has a condition on it which increases their damage by +1 (1 + 2 + 1 = 4). So now their total damage is 4 (1 Base + 2 Brutal + 1 Cheap Shot = 4 Total).

## Damage Types

There are 12 different damage types in the game, as seen in the list below. Each damage type represents a different method for harming a creature.

**Bludgeoning Damage:** Things that bludgeon you, like a hammer or fist.

**Piercing Damage:** Things that pierce you, like an arrow or fangs.

**Slashing Damage:** Things that slash you, like a blade or claw.

**Fire Damage:** Things that burn you, like fire or other forms of intense heat.

**Cold Damage:** Things that freeze you. like ice or intense cold.

**Lightning Damage:** Things that shock you, like lightning or other forms of electricity.

**Poison Damage:** Things that poison you, like toxins.

**Corrosion Damage:** Things that decay and wither you, like acids and rust effects.

**Psychic Damage:** Things that assault your mind, like psychic attacks.

**Radiant Damage:** Things that singe you, like holy light, lasers, and radiation.

**Umbral Damage:** Things that harm your soul, like dark or eldritch power.

**True Damage:** A special type of damage that can't be reduced by any means.

## Damage Type Categories

Damage types (except True damage) are organized into the following categories: Physical, Elemental, and Mystical.

**Physical Damage:** Includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**Elemental Damage:** Includes Cold, Corrosion, Fire, Lightning, and Poison.

**Mystical Damage:** Includes Psychic, Radiant, and Umbral.

## Damage Vulnerability, Resistance, & Immunity

Resistance is a way for creatures to reduce the damage they take, while Vulnerability increases damage taken. The source of what gives them this ability could come from a natural ability they have, a Class Feature, Magic Items, etc. Here are the different ways that these different effects work:

## Damage Resistance

**Resistance (X):** Damage taken of the specified type is reduced by X each time the creature takes damage of that type.

**Example:** If you had Fire Resistance (2) and took 7 Fire damage, you would instead take 5 Fire damage (you subtract 2 from the Fire damage taken, so 7-2 = 5).

**Resistance (Half):** Damage taken of the specified type is halved (minimum of 1 damage reduced).

**Example 1:** If you had Fire Resistance (Half) and took 7 Fire damage, you would instead take 4 Fire damage (half of 7 is 3.5, rounded up is 4).

**Example 2:** If you had Radiant Resistance and took 1 Radiant damage, the damage would be halved to 0.5 and rounded back up to 1 damage taken. However, since Resistance reduces damage by a minimum of 1, the damage would be reduced to 0.

## Damage Immunity

Damage taken of the specified type is reduced to 0.

**Example:** If you had Cold Immunity and were dealt 7 Cold damage, you would take 0 damage instead.

## Damage Vulnerability

**Vulnerability (X):** Increase damage taken by X each time the creature takes damage of that type.

**Example:** If you had Poison Vulnerability (2) and took 3 Poison damage, you would instead take 5 Poison damage (you add 2 to the Poison damage taken, so 3 + 2 = 5).

**Vulnerability (Double):** Increases the Damage taken by 2 times of the specified type.

**Example:** If a Werewolf has Vulnerability (Double) to Silvered Weapons and takes 5 damage from an Attack, they would instead take 10 damage (5 x 2 = 10).

## Damage Reduction

Damage Reduction (DR) grants Damage Resistance (Half) against Attacks, except against Critical Hits and Heavy Hits (or higher). There are 3 types of Damage Reduction:

**Physical Damage Reduction:** PDR protects you from the following damage types: Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing.

**Elemental Damage Reduction:** EDR protects you from the following damage types: Cold, Corrosion, Fire, Lightning, and Poison.

**Mystical Damage Reduction:** MDR protects you from the following damage types: Radiant, Psychic, and Umbral.

**DC Tip:** There can be specific types of DR for certain Damage Types that special items or monsters have. You could have something that even gives 'Fire Damage Reduction' for example.

**Example:** A creature makes an Attack to hit a target with an PD of 10. The result of their Check is 12, which hits the target and deals 4 Bludgeoning damage. The target has a PDR, which provides Bludgeoning Resistance against this Attack, and halves the damage to 2 (4 / 2 = 2). Alternatively, if the result of the Check was 15, it would be 5 over the target's PD of 10, making it a Heavy Hit. In this scenario, the PDR is bypassed, the damage isn't reduced, and the target takes the full 4 damage plus 1 damage for the Heavy Hit.

## Stacking Damage Vulnerabilities, Resistances, & Immunities

**Example:** If you had Fire Resistance (1) from an Ancestry Trait and Fire Resistance (1) from a Class Feature, these Resistances would be replaced by Fire Resistance (Half) instead. So if you took 4 Fire damage from an Attack, the damage would be reduced by half down to 2 damage (4 / 2 = 2).

## Damage Resistance X & Vulnerability X

A creature that gains Damage Resistance X or Damage Vulnerability X from multiple sources they are all added together.

## Damage Resistance (Half) & Vulnerability (Double)

Multiple sources of Damage Resistance (Half) or Damage Vulnerability (Double) do not stack.

**Example:** If you had Lightning Resistance (Half) from a Class Feature and Elemental Resistance (which includes Lightning Resistance) from the EDR granted by your Armor, you would still only take half damage when you take Lightning damage (not a quarter of the damage, because they don't stack).

## Bonus Damage

If an Attack gains a bonus to its damage (such as from a Feature or Enhancement), the bonus damage is the same type of damage as the Attack, unless otherwise stated.

## Multiple Damage Types

When an Attack deals multiple types of damage and gains a bonus to its damage, you choose which damage type gains the bonus damage.

**Example:** A Barbarian Hits a target with an Attack using a magical Hammer that deals 2 Bludgeoning damage and 2 Lightning damage. If the Barbarian is Raging at the time, they deal +1 damage from their Rage Feature. The Barbarian can choose to apply their Rage damage to the Bludgeoning or Lightning damage.

## Against Multiple Targets

If an Attack that targets multiple targets gains a bonus to its damage, the bonus damage only applies to 1 target of your choice.

**DC Tip:** The Attack still benefits from Critical Hits, Heavy Hits, and beyond against each target.

## Damage Modifications

Total damage is determined after all damage modifications are taken into account. When a creature takes damage, the total damage taken is determined by following the steps below:

### Adding & Subtracting

- **Damage Resistance X:** its Resist X reduces the damage by the value of X (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **Damage Vulnerability X:** its Vulnerable X increases the damage by the value of X (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### Doubling & Halving

- **Damage Resistance (Half):** The damage is halved (rounded up, minimum of 1 damage reduced).
- **Damage Vulnerability (Double):** The damage is doubled (minimum of 1 damage taken).

If a creature has the same type and amount of Resistance and Vulnerability, they cancel each other out (e.g. Fire Resistance (1) & Fire Vulnerability (1), or Cold Resistance (Double) & Cold Vulnerability (Double)).

**DC Tip:** Basically any kind of addition or subtraction of damage happens FIRST, then any multiplication or division of damage AFTER.

**Example 1:** A creature has Cold Resistance (1) from its Ancestry, and Cold Vulnerability (Double) from a Monster Effect. When that creature is Hit by an Attack that deals 4 Cold damage, the damage is reduced by 1 (Cold Resistance (1)) to a total of 3, and then doubled (Cold Vulnerability) to a total of 6.

**Example 2:** A creature has Fire Vulnerability (1) from its Ancestry, and Fire Resistance (Half) from the EDR granted by its Armor. When that creature is Hit by an Attack that deals 5 Fire damage, the damage is increased by 1 (Fire Vulnerability (1)) to a total of 6, and then halved (Fire Resistance (Half) from EDR) to a total of 3.

## Managing Damage Multiples

## Multiple Damage Types

When you take multiple types of damage that you have Resistances (or Vulnerabilities) to, you apply your Resistances (or Vulnerabilities) to each damage type individually.

**Example:** You have Physical Resistance (Half) from PDR granted by Armor and take 3 Piercing damage and 3 Slashing damage from an Attack. The Piercing damage would be reduced by half to 1.5, then rounded up to 2 damage taken. The same would be true of the Slashing damage (2 damage taken). You would take a total of 4 damage from the Attack.

## Bonus Damage Against Multiple Targets

If you add bonus damage to an Attack that targets multiple targets, the bonus damage only applies to 1 target of your choice. The Attack still benefits from Critical Hits, Heavy Hits, and beyond against each target.

## Shared Damage

When 2 or more creatures share damage, divide the damage by the number of creatures (rounding up), and distribute the damage equally among the creatures. If the creatures are sharing damage of multiple types, you calculate the shared damager for each type taken (see example 3)

**Example 1:** A Champion steps in front of an Attack against an ally and they share the damage. If the total damage was 5, then each creature now takes 3 damage (half of 5 is 2.5, rounded up to 3).

**Example 2:** A creature is thrown 10 Spaces into a wall, taking 10 Bludgeoning damage upon impact. However, if 2 creatures were to stand side-by-side in the thrown creature's path, all 3 creatures would share the damage upon impact. The 10 damage would be divided by the 3 creatures, resulting in each creature taking 3.33 Bludgeoning damage. No matter what the fraction is, you always round up in DC20, so now each creature takes 4 damage.

**Example 3:** A Barbarian steps in front of an Attack against an ally and they share the damage. If the total damage was 3 Bludgeoning and 2 Lightning damage, then each creature now takes 2 Bludgeoning (half of 3 is 1.5, rounded up to 2) and 1 Lightning damage.

**DC Tip:** Yes this does mean that sharing damage might result in the group as a whole taking more damage than if they had not shared the damage. This is on purpose and also accounts for everyone smashing into each other and truly sharing the blow.

# CHAPTER 2: Combat Rules

## Combat Resources

## Action Points

Action Points (AP) represent a character's moment-to-moment readiness in battle. Each character has a maximum of 4 AP, which they can spend to perform **Actions** or **Reactions**. Whether it's striking with a blade, casting a spell, or leaping from danger's path, managing AP wisely is key to surviving fast-paced encounters and making the most of every opportunity.

## Maximum AP

You have a maximum of 4 Action Points. You are considered to be taking an Action when you spend 1 or more Action Points. Once an Action Point is spent, it can't be used again until it's regained.

**Example:** A PC has 4 AP. They spend 1 AP to make an Attack with a Weapon they're wielding. They decide to spend 3 AP to improve their Attack: 1 AP to increase damage, 1 AP to increase their range, and 1 AP to gain ADV on the Attack. After spending all 4 AP, they can't take any more Actions until they regain their AP. See the 'Martial Enhancements' on page 50 for more information on enhancing your Attacks.

## Actions Out of Combat Sidebar

When you are not in Combat, there is no Initiative, so the GM decides how quickly time flows. They set the pace and determine how often creatures can take actions. In calm situations, you might have all the time you need, taking action after action without limit. In situations where time is short (such as a sneaking into a bandit's hideout), the GM may limit how many actions you can take to help track the order and urgency of events. You do not need to track movement the same way you do in Combat.

For example, nobody is counting every single Space someone walks while shopping in the market. Similarly, you do not spend Action Points out of Combat. You simply describe what you are doing. However, the number of Action Points you could spend in Combat can be a useful guideline for how much effort you can reasonably put into a single attempt at an activity.

**Beta Note:** We will be adding or changing the rules around Helping outside of Combat in a future update.

## Mana Points

Mana Points (MP) are the wellspring of magical power, allowing Spellcasters to unleash potent spells and supernatural effects. Unlike Stamina Points, MP can't be regained through action or effort during the day, instead fully replenishing only after a Long Rest. However, Spellcasters have a larger pool of MP than Martials do SP, and each Mana Point produces a greater effect than a Stamina Point, making every MP-fueled ability a more powerful expenditure of energy.

## MP Effects

Any ability or effect that costs MP is considered an MP Effect. This includes Spells, Class Features, or Talents that you spend MP to use.

## Maximum MP

You don't have Mana Points unless you choose a Spellcaster Class (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Spellblade\*, Warlock, and Wizard) or progress in the Spellcaster Path (see 'Character Paths' on page 161 for more information).

- **Spellcaster Class:** Spellcaster Classes have a maximum amount of MP as shown in the Mana Points column of their Spellcaster Class Table.
- **Spellcaster Path:** If you spend a Path point on the Spellcaster Path, you gain maximum amount of MP as shown on the Mana Points column of the Spellcaster Path Table.

## Mana Spend Limit

You can spend a maximum number of Mana Points to produce an MP Effect equal to your Combat Mastery. This limitation includes MP spent on Spell Enhancements and other Features that require MP. This is called your Mana Spend Limit (MSL).

**Example:** A level 6 Sorcerer (Combat Mastery of 3) can spend up to 3 MP on any Spell they cast. They could cast a Spell with a base cost of 3 MP, or they could cast a Spell with a base cost of 1 MP and spend 2 MP on Spell Enhancements. Alternatively, they could cast a Spell without an MP cost and spend 3 MP on Spell Enhancements.

**DC Tip:** The Mana Spend Limit is separate from the Stamina Spend Limit, meaning you could spend up to your MSL and up to you SSL on the same action, such as when using the Spellblade's Spellstrike Feature.

## Regaining MP

You regain all spent MP when you complete a Long Rest.

## Stamina Points

Stamina Points (SP) are a vital resource, empowering Martial characters to perform heroic feats beyond the limits of ordinary warriors. Each Martial Class has unique ways to regain SP, whether through relentless aggression, strategic maneuvers, or unwavering discipline, ensuring they can continue to push the limits of Combat.

## SP Effects

Any ability or effect that costs SP is considered an SP Effect. This includes Maneuvers, Class Features, or Talents that you spend SP to use.

## Maximum SP

You don't have Stamina Points unless you choose a Martial Class (Barbarian, Champion, Commander, Hunter, Rogue, Monk, and Spellblade\*) or progress in the Martial Path (see 'Character Paths' on page 161 for more information).

- **Martial Class:** Martial Classes have a maximum amount of SP as shown in the Stamina Points column of their Martial Class Table.
- **Martial Path:** If you spend a Path point on the Martial Path, you gain maximum amount of SP as shown on the Stamina Points column of the Martial Path Table.

## Stamina Spend Limit

You can spend a maximum number of Stamina Points to perform an SP Effect equal to your Combat Mastery. This limitation includes SP spent on Maneuver and Attack Enhancements and other Features that require SP. This is called your Stamina Spend Limit (SSL).

**Example:** A level 6 Barbarian (Combat Mastery of 3) can spend up to 3 SP on any SP Effect they perform. They could perform a Maneuver with a base cost of 3 SP, or they could perform a Maneuver with a base cost of 1 SP and spend 2 SP on Maneuver Enhancements. Alternatively, they could perform a Maneuver without an SP cost and spend 3 SP on Maneuver Enhancements.

**DC Tip:** The Stamina Spend Limit is separate from the Mana Spend Limit, meaning you could spend up to your SSL and up to you MSL on the same action, such as when using the Spellblade's Spellstrike Feature.

## Regaining SP

You regain all spent SP when Combat ends and when you complete a Short Rest.

**Martial Stamina Regen:** You can regain SP during Combat in a variety of ways depending on the Stamina Regen benefit granted by your Class or from the Martial Path (see the 'Character Paths' on page 161 chapter for more information).

**Example:** The Champion Class regains SP by performing Maneuvers, the Barbarian regains SP by taking or scoring Heavy, Brutal, and Critical Hits, and the Rogue regains SP by hitting creatures that are affected by Conditions.

## Grit Points

Characters with a high Charisma Attribute have a strong force of will. Grit Points represent a Character being able to push through and go beyond their limits in difficult situations.

## Maximum Grit Points

You have a maximum number of Grit Points equal to 2 + your Charisma (minimum of 0 Grit Points).

## Spending Grit Points

**Bearing Damage:** When you're Hit by an Attack, you can spend 1 or more Grit Points to reduce the damage you take by 1 per Grit Point spent.

**Save Resolve:** When you make a Save, you can spend Grit Points to grant yourself ADV on the Save. You must do so before you roll any dice as part of making the Save.

## Regaining Grit Points

You regain all spent Grit Points when you complete a Long Rest.

## Actions

Anything that you spend Action Points on is considered an Action.

## Taking an Action

A creature can take an Action on its turn by spending Action Points (AP). The AP cost of taking an Action is listed in the Action's description.

## Minor Action

Once per turn, you can perform up to 2 of the following tasks without spending AP. You can't take Actions (such as the Attack Action) between these 2 tasks.

- Open or Close a Door.
- Grab or Release an Item.
- Retrieve or Stow an Item.
- Draw or Sheathe a Weapon.

**Additional Minor Actions:** You can spend 1 AP to perform a Minor Action again during the same turn.

## Types of Actions

A creature can take the following Actions on its turn: Attack, Move, Disengage, Dodge, Grapple, Help, Hide, Object, Shove, and Spell Action.

## Offensive Actions

### Attack

You can spend 1 AP to make 1 Attack Check.

### Disarm

You can spend 1 AP to make an Attack Check contested by the target's Athletics, Acrobatics, or Trickery Check (target's choice), the target has ADV if they're holding the object with 2 hands, you have DisADV if the target is larger than you. You can't Disarm a creature that's 2 Sizes larger than you. **Success:** The targeted object falls into an unoccupied space of your choice within 1 Space of the creature.

### Grapple

Using a free hand, you can spend 1 AP to attempt to Grapple another creature within 1 Space. Make an Athletics Check contested by the opposing creature's Acrobatics or Athletics Check. You or the target may have ADV or DisADV on your Check based on each other's size. **Success:** The creature is Grappled by you.

**Moving the Target:** You can move the target to any Space adjacent to you by spending your own Movement to do so. Alternatively, when you move, you can move the target with you, but you're considered Slowed (Every 1 Space you move costs an extra 1 Space of movement).

**Multiple Grapplers:** If you attempt to move or throw a target (see 'Throw Creature' on page 56) that's also Grappled by 1 or more other creatures, you must make a Contested Athletics Check against all the other Grapplers. **Success:** You move or throw the target as normal and break the Grapple of all other creatures who were also Grappling that target.

**Ending a Grapple:**

- **Escape Grapple:** The target can spend 1 AP to attempt to free itself from the Grapple. When it does, it makes an Acrobatics or Athletics Check contested by your Athletics Check. **Success:** The Grapple immediately ends.
- **Incapacitated Grappler:** If you become Incapacitated, the Grapple immediately ends.
- **Forced Movement:** If an effect attempts to forcibly move the target beyond your reach, you make the Check or Save instead of the target. If the effect targets both you and the target, you make 1 Check or Save for both of you. **Success:** The targets of the effect are not moved. **Failure:** The Grapple immediately ends, and the targets of the effect are moved.
- **Falling:** If the target begins falling (and you don't), the Grapple ends if you can't carry the target's weight. If you can carry its weight, you hold it suspended in the air.

### Shove

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to push a creature within 1 Space of you. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target's Acrobatics or Athletics Check. **Success:** You push the creature 1 Space away from you or to its left or right. **Success (each 5):** Push up to 1 additional Space.

**Knock Prone:** After the result, you can choose to reduce the total distance the target is pushed by 1 Space to knock them Prone instead.

**DC Tip:** If you shove a creature into a target, follow the rules for hitting the target in the Collision section.

### Tackle

If you move at least 2 Spaces in a straight line, you can spend 1 AP to attempt to Tackle a creature that's your Size or smaller. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target's Acrobatics or Athletics Check. **Success:** You Grapple the target and you both move 1 Space in the same direction you're moving then immediately fall Prone. **Success (each 5):** +1 Space moved.

## Defensive Actions

### Disengage

You can spend 1 AP to impose DisADV on Opportunity Attacks made against you until the start of your next turn.

**Full Disengage:** When you take the Disengage Action, you can spend an additional 1 AP to become Immune to Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.

### Dodge

You can spend 1 AP to impose DisADV on the next Attack or Grapple made against you before the start of your next turn.

**Full Dodge:** When you take the Dodge Action, you can spend an additional 1 AP to impose DisADV on all Attacks or Grapples made against you until the start of your next turn.

### Hide

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to Hide from 1 or more creatures that can't see you (Unseen). Make a Stealth Check against any opposing creatures' Passive Awareness. **Success:** You become Hidden from creatures whose Passive Awareness you beat (making you Unseen and Unheard by them). You remain Hidden until you make a noise louder than a whisper, make an Attack, cast a Spell with a Verbal Component, or a creature takes the Search Action and successfully locates you.

See 'Hidden Creatures' on page 132 for more on hiding.

**DC Tip:** When you take the Hide Action and beat an enemy's Passive Awareness, you only become Hidden from that creature because it can't see or hear you (you are both Unseen and Unheard). However, if your Stealth Check beats one enemy's Awareness Score but not another's, then you are Hidden from the first enemy, but you're not Hidden from the second enemy.

## Utility Actions

### Move

You can spend 1 AP to move up to your Speed in Spaces (default of 5). You choose where to move, and can break up your movement by moving before and after taking a different Action. You can't end your turn in a Space occupied by another creature.

**Example:** A creature with 4 AP can take the Move Action to move 1 Space, take the Attack Action, move 1 Space again (2 total Spaces), take the Attack Action again, and then move 2 Spaces again (4 total Spaces).

### Help

You can spend 1 AP to grant another creature a d8 Help Die that lasts until the start of your next turn. Upon granting the Help Die, you must declare which creature you're Helping and the type of Check you'll be aiding them with, while meeting the following conditions:

- **Attack:** You declare 1 target for the Attack. You must be within 1 Space of the Attacker or the target of the Attack. While the Help Die lasts, it can be added to an Attack made against the target.
- **Skill or Trade Check:** You declare a type of Skill or Trade Check. You describe how you're Helping them and must do so with a Skill or Trade that you have at least 1 Mastery Level in. You can use the same Skill or Trade or a different one.

The Help Die can only be used to aid the type of Check declared and disappears once it's used.

**Multiple Help Penalty:** Once you take the Help Action, each time you take the Help Action again before the end of your turn, your Help Die decay by 1 step, to a minimum of a d4 (d8 > d6 > d4). These Help Dice only decay when using the Help Action. Help Die granted by other sources decay independently of any Help Dice grant through the Help Action.

**Example:** A Barbarian is about to wrestle an alligator and will need to make an Athletics Checks. A Hunter with Mastery in the Animal Skill can grant the Barbarian a Help Die to add to their Athletics Check made to wrestle the alligator.

**DC Tip:** When taking the Help Action, the GM may allow the PC to contribute to a Skill or Trade Check by using something other than their own Skill or Trade Mastery. If the PC is a Wizard, they may try to use a Spell to contribute to another creature's Skill or Trade Check, but only if the GM decides that it makes sense to do so.

### Object

You can spend 1 AP to perform 1 of the following object interactions:

- Drink a Potion or Administer a Potion to another Creature.
- Attempt to Lock or Unlock a Lock.
- Make a Trickery Check to activate or disable a trap or other mechanism.
- Transfer an Item to or from another Creature (only 1 of the two creatures spends 1 AP).
- Throw an Item to location you can see up to 5 Spaces away.

### Spell

You can spend 1 or more AP to cast a Spell that you know. If the Spell has a Mana Point requirement, you must spend that much MP to cast the Spell.

### Sustained Action

You must spend 1 AP at the start of each of your turns to Sustain an effect until the start of your next turn. You can't Sustain an effect while Dazed. When you become Dazed, any effect you're Sustaining ends. You can choose to end the effect at anytime for free.

**Outside of Combat:** You can only Sustain 1 effect at a time outside of Combat. If you attempt to Sustain a second effect while already Sustaining a first, the first effect immediately ends.

## Skill Based Actions

A creature can take the following Skill Actions on its turn: Analyze Creature, Calm Animal, Combat Insight, Conceal, Feint, Intimidate, Investigate, Jump, Medicine, Mounted Defense, Pass Through, or Search.

### Analyze Creature

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to recall or discern some information about a creature that you can see or hear. Make a DC 10 Knowledge Check.

**Success:** You learn a piece of lore about the creature. **Success (each 5):** You learn 1 creature statistic (PD, AD, Attacks, Abilities, Resistances, Vulnerabilities, Immunities, etc.)

**DC Tip:** There are 5 types of Knowledge Checks related to creature types: Arcana (Constructs, Monstrosities, and Oozes), History (Dragons, Giants, and Humanoids), Nature (Beasts, Elementals, Fey, and Plants), Occultism (Aberrations, Fiends, and Undead), and Religion (Celestials). If a PC has a custom Knowledge Trade they think might help in the situation, they can ask the GM to use that Knowledge Trade instead.

### Calm Animal

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to beguile a Beast that can see or hear you. Make an Animal Check contested by the target's Repeated Charisma Save.

**Success:** The animal is Taunted by you for 1 minute or until you target it with a harmful Attack, Spell, or other effect. **Success (5):** It's instead Intimidated. **Success (10):** It's also Charmed.

### Combat Insight

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to discern the course of actions a creature might take on its next turn. Make an Insight Check contested by the target's Trickery or Influence Check (its choice).

**Success:** You learn the target's emotional state and whether it plans to make an Attack, cast a Spell, or flee combat during its next turn. **Success (5):** You know who the creature is likely to target with a harmful ability. **Success (10):** You know which ability the creature plans to use.

**DC Tip:** If the target is a PC, its player tells you what the creature plans to do. If the target is an NPC, the GM tells you what the creature plans to do.

### Conceal

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to hide an object on yourself or in nearby foliage, debris, or decor to render it Hidden. Make a contested Trickery Check against the Passive Awareness of creatures that can see you.

**Success:** The object is Hidden from any creature whose Passive Awareness you beat.

### Feint

You can spend 1 AP to make a Trickery Check contested by the Insight Check of a creature that can see you within 3 Spaces.

**Success:** The next Attack against the target before the start of your next turn has ADV and deals +1 damage.

### Intimidate

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to intimidate a creature that can see or hear you within 10 Spaces. Make an Intimidation Check contested by the target's Charisma Save. **Success:** The target is Intimidated by you for 1 Round.

### Investigate

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to uncover a concealed object on a creature, a secret compartment, or the intended function of a mechanism within 1 Space of you.

- **Concealed Objects:** You can attempt to uncover any objects concealed on a creature. Make an Investigation Check contested by the target's Trickery Check. **Success:** You know the location of any concealed object on the creature.
- **Secret Compartments:** You can attempt to uncover any secret compartments. Make an Investigation Check against the discovery DC of any secret compartments. **Success:** You discover the location of any secret compartments whose discovery DC you beat.
- **Discern Mechanism:** You can attempt to discern the functionality of a mechanism (the effect of a trap, how to open a secret door, or activate a device). Make an Investigation Check. **Success:** You learn how the mechanism works and the methods to activate and disable it (if any).

### Extend Jump

When you perform a Jump, you can spend 1 AP to increase your Jump Distance for the Jump. Make a DC 10 Acrobatics Check. **Failure:** Your Jump Distance increases by 1. **Success:** Your Jump Distance increases by 2. **Success (each 5):** +1 Jump Distance.

**DC Tip:** Remember, your Long Jump Distance equals your Jump Distance in Spaces, and your High Jump distance equals your Jump Distance in feet.

### Medicine

You can spend 1 AP to touch a creature and tend to its wounds. Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. **Success:** You end 1 stack of Bleeding on the target. **Success (each 5):** You end 1 additional stack of Bleeding on the target.

### Mounted Defense

You can spend 1 AP to maneuver a mount you're riding to avoid danger. Make a DC 10 Animal Check.

**Success:** The mount's PD increases by 2 until the start of your next turn. **Success (5):** +2 PD. **Success (10):** +4 PD.

### Pass Through

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to move through a Space occupied by a hostile creature that's within 1 size of you. Make a contested Martial Check against the target. **Success:** You can move through the creature's Space as if it were Difficult Terrain (Slowed while moving through the area). **Success (5):** You can move through the creature's space without it counting as Difficult Terrain.

### Search

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to locate 1 or more Hidden creatures and concealed objects within your Line of Sight.

- **Hidden Creatures:** You attempt to locate any Hidden creatures in the area. Make an Awareness Check against the Stealth Check of any Hidden creatures. **Success:** You know the location of any Hidden creature whose Stealth Check you beat until the end of your turn. Knowing a creature's location doesn't grant you the ability to see it.
- **Hidden Objects:** You attempt to locate any Hidden objects in the area. Make an Awareness Check against the DC to discover any concealed objects (such as traps, secret doors, or hidden items). **Success:** You discover the location of any Hidden object whose discovery DC you beat.

**DC Tip:** Without obstruction, a PC's line of sight could reach the horizon. You might ask your PC to make their Awareness Check with Disadvantage to detect a creature that's far away, such as beyond 10 Spaces.

### Taunt

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to taunt a creature that can see or hear you within 10 Spaces. Make an Influence Check contested by the target's Charisma Save. **Success:** The target is Taunted by you for 1 Round.

## Advanced Actions

### Held Actions

Sometimes the circumstances aren't exactly right for the action you want to take. When that happens, you can choose to wait until just the right moment by Holding your Action. To Hold your Action, you must declare an Action you want to take and state a Trigger. Once you do so, you can't change the Action or Trigger.

- **Declare Action:** When you declare the Action, you must immediately spend the Action Points required to take that Action. The Multiple Check Penalty from this turn applies to any Checks you make as part of this Reaction.
- **State Trigger:** The Trigger must be an observable event, such as 'I want to wait until an enemy moves into range to make an Attack against them', 'I want to wait until I see my ally get out of range before I shoot the barrel filled with explosives', or something else.
- **Take Reaction:** If the stated Trigger occurs at any time before the start of your next turn, you can take the declared Action as a Reaction. If the Reaction requires you to spend any additional resources (such as Stamina Points or Mana Points) you spend them now. Your Reaction interrupts the events stated in the Trigger, allowing you to act before the events resolve. If the Trigger never occurs, then the declared Action can't be taken and the AP spent is wasted.

**Example:** It's your turn and you have 2 AP remaining to spend, but you really want to work together with an ally. You tell the GM that you want to spend 2 AP on Held Actions. You declare that you will be taking the Move Action and the Attack Action and you spend 2 AP right now. You also state the Trigger for these Held Actions is 'your ally is in melee range of an enemy'. Once the Trigger occurs you take those 2 Actions immediately. You take a Move Action to move to the creatures and then you make an Attack Action on a creature. If the creatures are too far away for 1 Move Action (1 AP), then you would only be able to move as far as you can and the Attack Action (1 AP) is wasted since you were not close enough to make an Attack. You can't convert the 1 AP spent on the Attack Action into another Move Action, since that's not what you declared.

**DC Tip:** PCs can set triggers to be something less specific like, 'I'm going to shoot an arrow at the next enemy I see.' Just make sure the PC and the GM are on the same page on what the intent of what they're wanting to do is for their Reactions Trigger.

## Reactions

Reactions are Actions that a creature can take during another creature's turn. A creature can't take a Reaction on their own turn, unless the Reaction allows them to do so in response to another creature's Reaction. Reactions are not affected by the Multiple Check Penalty.

## Taking a Reaction

A creature can take a Reaction on another creature's turn provided it meets the requirements to do so. The requirements to take a Reaction are listed in the Reaction's Prerequisite and Trigger statements. You can only take 1 Reaction per Trigger.

**Example 1:** When a creature leaves a Martial PC's reach, they would only be able to make 1 Opportunity Attack against the creature (they could still spend AP to perform Martial Enhancements with their Opportunity Attack).

**Example 2:** When an Attack is made within 1 Space of a Martial PC, the PC could take the Parry Maneuver against the Attack (1st trigger). If the Attack still Hits (2nd trigger), the PC could take the Protection Maneuver to share the damage with the target.

## Reaction Requirements

- **Prerequisite:** A prerequisite states the Feature (Martial Feature, Spellcasting Feature, or a different Feature) required to gain access to the Reaction.
- **Trigger:** A trigger states the conditions that must be met in order for a creature to take the Reaction.

## Spending Resources

If a Reaction has a resource cost (Action Points, Mana Points, Stamina Points, etc.), a creature must spend those resources to take the Reaction.

**Regaining Resources:** Reactions give a creature an opportunity to spend Action Points during another creature's turn. If a creature spends Action Points, they'll have less Action Points to spend on their next turn. Any spent Action Points are not regained until the end of a creature's turn.

**Example:** If you take a Reaction to spend 1 Action Point, on your next turn you will only have 3 Action Points to use (4 - 1 = 3).

**DC Tip:** If you somehow manage to spend all 4 of your AP before your turn, then you would have 0 AP at the start of your next turn. You wouldn't be able to do anything, so your turn would immediately end and you'd get your 4 AP back.

**Multiple Reactions:** A creature can spend Action Points to take multiple Reactions provided they meet all the conditions and can spend enough resources to do so.

## Types of Reactions

### Opportunity Attack

**Prerequisite:** Martial Path

**Trigger:** A creature you can see within your Melee Range uses its movement to leave your Melee Range, draws a Weapon or Spell Focus, picks an item up off the ground, or takes the Object Action.

**Reaction:** You can spend 1 AP to make a Melee Martial Attack against the provoking creature.

**DC Tip:** You can spend additional AP to gain ADV or to perform Maneuvers with the Attack.

### Spell Duel

**Prerequisite:** Spellcasting Path

During a Spell Duel, the creature casting the Spell is referred to as the **Caster** and the opposing creature is referred to as the **Challenger**.

If multiple creatures attempt to initiate a Spell Duel, one of them must be chosen as the **Challenger**, while the others assist them through **Combo Casting**. Additional creatures can also choose to assist the Caster when a Spell Duel is initiated (see 'Combo Spellcasting' on page 66 for more information).

**Trigger:** You see an MP Effect being cast, provided the Caster or a target is within 5 Spaces of you.

**Reaction:** You can spend an amount of AP and 1 or more MP (up to your Mana Spend Limit) to attempt to stop the Caster's MP Effect. The amount of AP spent is equal to the base AP cost of the MP Effect you're trying to stop.

**Contest:** Make a Spell Check contested by the Spell Check or Spell Attack that the Caster makes to cast their MP Effect. If the Caster's MP Effect doesn't require a Check, they have to make a Spell Check as a Reaction as part of the Spell Duel. For the purposes of the Spell Duel, the Caster and Challenger each gain a bonus to their Check equal to twice the MP spent they spent respectively.

**Beta Note:** Since enemies don't have MP costs for their MP Effects, you can assume their MP Effects cost an amount of MP equal to half their Level (rounded up).

**Outcomes:**

- **Success:** The Caster's MP Effect fails and has no effect.
- **Failure:** The Caster's MP Effect succeeds and takes effect. The Check bonus gained from MP spent doesn't apply to the MP Effect's Success and Failure Statements.
- **Tie:** The Caster's MP Effect fails, has no effect, and you each roll on the Wild Magic Surge Table. The effect from the table lasts until 1 Round has passed.

**Resources Lost:** Whatever the result, each creature still spends all AP, MP, or other resources as normal.

**Example:** A Caster makes an MP based Spell Attack and a Challenger attempts to stop it. The Caster's Spell Attack cost 1 AP and 2 MP. The Challenger must spend 1 AP and at least 1 MP to attempt to stop the Spell Attack. The Caster makes an Attack Check (since its a Spell Attack) and the Challenger makes a Spell Check. The Caster gets a +4 bonus to their Attack Check (2 MP spent) and the Challenger gets a +2 bonus to their Spell Check (1 MP spent). Should the Caster win the Contest, their MP Effect takes effect but they don't include the +4 bonus from MP spent to determine if they score a Heavy Hit or higher.

## Martial Chapter

Martial characters in DC20 don't merely fight - they wage war with precision, discipline, and skill that elevates them far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary sword-wielder. Their prowess is represented through a specialized combat system which includes:

- **Maneuvers:** Tactical feats of strength, speed, and finesse used to control the battlefield.
- **Enhancements:** Modifications to Maneuvers that add extra impact, reach, area effects, or debilitating conditions, or upgrades that empower Martial Attacks with increased damage, range, or area of effect.

## Maneuvers

Maneuvers are the signature techniques of martial combatants; deliberate, high-impact actions that go beyond basic attacks. Whether it's a sweeping strike to knock enemies back or a sudden burst of speed to reposition, Maneuvers allow warriors to control the flow of battle with skill and force.

## Maneuvers Known

Martial Classes (Barbarian, Champion, Commander, Hunter, Rogue, Monk, and Spellblade\*) know a number of Maneuvers as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of their Class Tables, plus any Maneuvers learned from Class Features, Talents, or Martial Path progression (see 'Character Paths' on page 161 for more information).

## Maneuver Resources

Each Maneuver has a minimum number of Action Points (AP) that must be spent to perform it. Many Maneuvers also include a minimum number of Stamina Points (SP) that must be spent to perform them. This is known as the Base SP Cost of a Maneuver.

### Action Points

Performing any Maneuver requires spending Action Points (AP). Maneuvers that affect a single target typically cost 1 AP, while those that affect multiple targets usually cost 2 AP.

### Stamina Points

Some Maneuvers have an SP cost that you must spend to perform them. The maximum amount of SP you can spend on a single Maneuver must be equal to or lower than your Stamina Spend Limit (see 'Combat Resources' on page 41 for more information on Stamina Points).

**DC Tip:** Remember, your Stamina Spend Limit is equal to your Combat Mastery.

## Maneuver Characteristics

### Duration

Maneuvers can either be instantaneous or continuous in their duration, and some Maneuvers require you to Sustain them in order to keep them going (see the 'Sustained Action' on page 44 for more information).

- **Instantaneous:** Instantaneous Maneuvers take effect the moment they're performed.
- **Continuous:** These Maneuvers last a specified amount of time. They often end early when the affected creature Succeeds on a subsequent Save against the effect, it or another creature within 1 Space performs an Action to end the effect, or some other method stated to end the effect occurs (such as breaking line of sight).
- **Sustained:** Some effects require you to Sustain them or they end.

### Range

This is the distance within which a target of the Maneuver, or the origin of its Area of Effect, must be. When selecting the targets of your Maneuver, they must be within the listed Range and fulfill any other listed requirement of the Maneuver (such as being visible or capable of hearing you). If the chosen Maneuver uses an Area of Effect to determine its targets, the origin of the Maneuver must be within its listed Range (see 'Areas of Effect' on page 126 for more information).

## Performing a Maneuver

In order to perform a Maneuver, you must know the Maneuver and spend the required amount of Resources (Action Points and Stamina Points). When you perform a Maneuver, you must make a Check (such as an Attack Check or Martial Check) to determine the Maneuver's degree of success or failure. Your Check is compared against the target's Defense (such as PD or AD), the Maneuver's DC, or the target's Contested Check.

## Enhancements

Enhancements amplify the impact of a character's offense, turning well-executed strikes into devastating blows. They can increase damage, extend range, affect wider areas, or inflict conditions, allowing martial characters to adapt to the shifting demands of battle.

## Maneuver Enhancements

Maneuver Enhancements allow you to spend additional AP or SP to increase the Maneuver's potency (such as damage, duration, range, number of targets, or Area of Effect). Maneuver Enhancements are specific to each Maneuver and are included in a Maneuver's description.

## Performing a Maneuver Enhancement

When you perform a Maneuver, you can spend additional SP to add a Maneuver Enhancement with the Maneuver. If the Maneuver requires a Check (such as an Attack Check or Martial Check), you must choose to add the Maneuver Enhancement before you make the Check. You can perform the same Maneuver Enhancement multiple times per Maneuver, unless stated otherwise.

## Martial Enhancements

Martial Enhancements empower a character's Martial Attacks with added force and versatility. By spending Action Points, a combatant can strike harder, reach farther, or break a foe's focus. These enhancements allow martial characters to elevate even their simplest strikes into potent tools of war, adapting on the fly to pressure, positioning, or opportunity. Some Attack Enhancements require a certain type of Weapon to perform (see 'Equipment' on page 133 for more information).

**Example:** When you make an Attack with an Axe against 3 creatures using the Whirlwind Maneuver, you can spend 1 AP to add the Martial Enhancement: Damage and 1 AP to add the Attack Enhancement: Bleeding available only to Axes. 1 target of your choice takes +1 damage from the Attack and another target of your choice (can be the same target) must make a Save against your Save DC to avoid Bleeding.

## Performing a Martial Enhancement

When you make a Martial Attack, you can spend 1 additional AP or SP to add a Martial Enhancement to the Attack. You must choose to add the Martial Enhancement before you make the Attack Check. You can perform the same Enhancement multiple times per Attack, unless stated otherwise.

**DC Tip:** Don't forget anyone can spend an additional 1 AP to gain ADV on their Attack Check.

## Martial Enhancements List

All characters with Weapon Combat Training gain access to the following Martial Enhancements:

- **Damage:** The Attack deals +1 damage against 1 target of the Attack.
- **Range:** The Attack's Range increase by 1 Space if it's a Melee Attack, or by 5 Spaces if it's a Ranged Attack. This Enhancement can only be performed once per attack.
- **Daze:** A creature of your choice targeted by the Attack makes a Might Save against your Save DC. **Save Failure:** The target becomes Dazed until the end of their next turn.

**DC Tip:** Remember, a Dazed creature can't Sustain any effects at the start of their turn! While Martial characters can't stop a Spell from being cast like a Spellcaster can with a Spell Duel, a Martial Character can more easily disrupt a Sustained Spell by causing the Spellcaster to lose focus.

**Example:** You spend 2 AP and 1 SP on an Attack against an enemy creature. 1 AP to take the Attack Action (make 1 Attack Check), 1 AP to add the Martial Enhancement: Damage to deal +1 damage, and 1 SP to add the Martial Enhancement: Range to grant your Attack some extra range.

## Categorizing Maneuvers

## Maneuver Types

There are several types of Maneuvers that allow you to produce a variety of powerful effects.

### Attack

Focused on delivering powerful, aggressive strikes, Attack Maneuvers deal damage, and are the core of a martial character's offensive toolkit—optimized for impact, precision, or area control.

### Defense

Defense Maneuvers reinforce durability and survival. Whether by parrying incoming blows, bracing against force, or redirecting attacks, these Maneuvers let martial characters hold the line and protect themselves or allies under pressure.

### Grapple

Grapple Maneuvers specialize in close-quarters control: pinning, restraining, or throwing enemies. These Maneuvers allow a combatant to dominate a single opponent by controlling their movement and actions.

### Utility

Utility Maneuvers offer battlefield versatility beyond direct combat. They may include repositioning, movement tricks, environmental interaction, intimidation, or setting up allies for success. These Maneuvers shift the flow of battle through clever use of space and timing.

## Advanced Maneuvers

## Combo Maneuvers

**Prerequisite:** Martial Path

During a Combo Maneuver, the creature performing the SP Effect is referred to as the **Performer** while the other creatures assisting are called **Participants**.

**Trigger:** You can see an SP Effect you know being performed, provided the SP Effect's Performer or a target is within 2 Space of you.

**Reaction:** You can spend an amount of AP equal to the base AP cost of the SP Effect you are trying to assist. When you do, the SP Effect gains a +2 bonus to its Check and Save DC for this turn.

**Spending SP:** You can choose to spend 1 or more SP to add SP Enhancements to the Performer's SP Effect (up to your Stamina Spend Limit).

**Example:** Martials A & B each have a Stamina Spend Limit of 3. Martial A spends 1 AP and 3 SP to perform the Bash Maneuver. Martial B can also spend 1 AP and 3 SP as a Reaction to increase the total SP spent on the Maneuver to 6 (the Stamina Spend Limit of both Martials together). Martial A then gains a +2 bonus to their Martial Attack.

**DC Tip:** Martials must be within 2 Spaces of each other when performing a Combo Maneuver but they can spend Stamina Points up to each of their Stamina Spend Limits together. However, Spellcasters performing a Combo Spellcasting can do so from a range of 5 Spaces but they can only spend a total amount of Mana Points equal to only the Caster's Mana Spend Limit.

## Maneuvers List

## Attack Maneuvers

Each creature within the Line must make a Martial Check contested against your Check when you attempt to move through its Space. **Contest Success:** You can move through the creature's Space. **Contest Failure:** You're unable to move through the creature's Space, preventing you from moving any further.

**Example:** You make a Martial Check with a result of 15. If your Speed is 5, you can move up to 5 Spaces in a straight Line. If there are 3 creatures in that Line, your Martial Check of 15 would be compared to a Martial Check each creature makes as you attempt to pass through their Space, one by one. If the first creature in your path gets a 15 or higher, you can't pass through their Space and stop moving.

**Maneuver Enhancements:**

# Spellcaster Chapter

Spellcasters in DC20 wield arcane, divine, or primal forces that reshape reality through intellect, willpower, or devotion. Their talents go far beyond simple incantations. Each spell cast is a calculated use of magical power, refined through discipline and mastery. This system of structured magic is expressed through:

- **Spells:** Magical effects that deal damage, heal wounds, alter terrain, or influence minds.
- **Spell Enhancements:** Modifiers that increase a spell's range, area, duration, or potency.

## Spells Known

Spellcaster Classes (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Spellblade\*, Warlock, and Wizard) know a number of Spells as shown in the Spells Known column of their Class Tables, plus again Spells learned from Class Features, Talents, or Spellcaster Path progression (see 'Character Paths' on page 161 for more information).

## Spell List

Spellcaster Classes each have different Spell Lists which specify the types of Spells they're able to learn. Martial Classes can gain access to a Spell List through gaining Spellcaster Path progression or the Spellcasting Expansion Talent (see 'Talents' on page 155 for more information).

**Example:** The Wizard Class specifies the Arcane as the Spells they can learn. When the Wizard learns Spells at 1st level or higher from their Class, they must choose from the Spells with Arcane listed as a Source (see Spell Sources later in this chapter). If they gain another Spell Source through the Spellcaster Expansion Talent, then they can learn new Spells from any of their Spell Sources.

## Spell Resources

Each Spell has a minimum number of Action Points (AP) that must be spent to cast it. Many Spells also include a minimum number of Mana Points (MP) that must also be spent to cast them. This is known as the Base Mana Cost of a Spell.

### Action Points

Casting any Spell requires spending Action Points (AP). Spells that affect a single target typically cost 1 AP, while those that affect multiple targets usually cost 2 AP.

### Mana Points

Some Spells have an MP cost that you must spend to cast them. The maximum amount of MP you can spend on a single Spell must be equal to or lower than your Mana Spend Limit (see 'Combat Resources' on page 41 for more information on Mana Points).

**DC Tip:** Remember, your Mana Spend Limit is equal to your Combat Mastery.

## Spell Characteristics

### Components

There are 3 types of Components that a Spell could have: Verbal, Somatic, and Material. All Spells require Verbal and Somatic components, unless stated otherwise. A few rare Spells require Material components. In order to cast any Spell you must satisfy its Components outlined below.

**Verbal:** These are the magical words and incantations needed to manifest the magical effects of a spell. This represents the PC uttering a few words to cast the Spell.

- Creatures that can hear you will notice that you're casting a Spell.
- If you're silenced by either magical or mundane means (Muffle Spell or your mouth is gagged) you can't cast Spells with a Verbal Component.
- You can still speak underwater to cast a Spell, but you lose your Breath (see Breath).

**DC Tip:** From a roleplay perspective, the PC could say a specific word, a phrase, or a strange sound. It's just important for both GM and Player to understand that the PC is making a sound of some kind when casting a Spell.

**Somatic:** These are the gestures, movements, and physical actions needed to control the magical energies within a Spell.

- Creatures that can see you will notice that you're casting a Spell.
- You need to be able to move at least one hand that's not holding an object, or have a Spell Focus to satisfy the Somatic Component.

**DC Tip:** From a roleplay perspective, the PC could move their arms around in a grand display or use simple hand gestures. It's just important for both GM and Player to understand that the PC is visibly moving their hand around when casting a Spell.

**Material:** These are objects, items, ingredients, and other physical items needed to cast the Spell. Most Spells do not have Material Components required to cast them, but those that do usually either have a high gold cost or use an item that the GM can determine the rarity of.

- You can't cast these Spells without having the Material Component.
- If the Spell consumes the Material Component, you must replace it before you can cast it again.
- Could have a high gold cost or be rare to obtain the item.

**DC Tip:** From a roleplay perspective, the PC could weave the Spell Components into their description of them casting a Spell. Players that want to add flavor to their spellcasting can create their own Material Components for a Spell (like slime from a frog to cast the Grease Spell). But these 'flavor' Components should not be held against them by the GM, unless the Player wants to track how many Spell Components they have.

### Duration

Spells can either be instantaneous or continuous in their duration, and some Spells require you to Sustain them in order to keep them going (see the 'Sustained Action' on page 44 for more information).

- **Instantaneous:** Instantaneous Spells take effect the moment they're performed.
- **Continuous:** These Spells last a specified amount of time. They often end early when the affected creature Succeeds on a subsequent Save against the effect, it or another creature within 1 Space performs an Action to end the effect, or some other method stated to end the effect occurs (such as breaking line of sight).
- **Sustained:** Some effects require you to Sustain them or they end.

### Range

This is the distance within which a target of the Spell, or the origin of its Area of Effect, must be. When selecting the targets of your Spell, they must be within the listed Range and fulfill any other listed requirement of the Spell (such as being visible or capable of hearing you). If the chosen Spell uses an Area of Effect to determine its targets, the origin of the Spell must be within its listed Range (see 'Areas of Effect' on page 126 for more information).

## Casting a Spell

In order to cast a Spell, you must know the Spell and spend the required amount of Resources (Action Points and Mana Points). When you cast a Spell, you must make a Check (such as an Attack Check or Spell Check) to determine the Spell's degree of success or failure. Your Check is compared against the target's Defense (such as PD or AD), the Spell's DC, or the target's Contested Check.

## Enhancements

Enhancements amplify the impact of a character's offense, turning well-executed strikes into devastating blows. They can increase damage, extend range, affect wider areas, or inflict conditions, allowing spellcaster characters to adapt to the shifting demands of battle.

## Spell Enhancements

Spell Enhancements allow you to spend additional AP or MP to increase the Spell's potency (such as damage, duration, range, number of targets, or Area of Effect). Spell Enhancements are specific to each Spell and are included in a Spell's description.

## Performing a Spell Enhancement

When you perform a Spell, you can spend additional MP to add a Spell Enhancement with the Spell. If the Spell requires a Check (such as an Attack Check or Spell Check), you must choose to add the Spell Enhancement before you make the Check. You can perform the same Spell Enhancement multiple times per Spell, unless stated otherwise.

**Mana Points on AP Enhancements:** You can spend 1 MP to add 2 AP worth of AP Enhancements to a Spell. You can do this multiple times per Spell.

**Example:** A Spell has an AP Enhancement called Damage that allows the caster to spend 1 AP to increase the Spell's damage by 1. Alternatively, the caster could spend 1 MP to add 2 AP worth of AP Enhancements to the Spell, such as choosing the Damage option twice (total of +2 damage).

## Enhancement Damage

If an Enhancement deals damage, it deals the same type of damage as the Spell you're using to perform the Attack or Spell, unless stated otherwise.

## Categorizing Spells

In DC20, every Spell is organized by 3 distinct categories: its **Source**, **School**, and **Tags**. Together, these categories explain where a Spell's power originates, how it's understood in the world, and how it functions within the rules. This makes every spell in DC20 a fully defined part of the magical system, rooted in lore, tied to character identity, and shaped for strategic gameplay.

Spellcasters may gain the ability to draw power from a Source of Magic through:

- Rigorous study and arcane practice, unlocking secrets from tomes and teachings (Wizards).
- A deep faith and devotion to a divine being (Clerics).
- Pacts with powerful entities that grant magical gifts in exchange for service (Warlocks).
- Their bond with the natural world and its primal forces (Druids).
- Blood inheritance or life-altering origins (Sorcerers).
- Artistic expression and emotional resonance (Bards).
- Sacred oaths, powerful relics, supernatural forces, or deeply personal sources (Spellblades).

## Sources of Magic

Sources of Magic represent the origin of magic. All Spells draw power from at least one of the three fundamental Sources: **Arcane**, **Divine**, or **Primal**. These Sources determine how a Spellcaster accesses and channels magic. Some Spells list 2 or more types as their Source (such as both Arcane and Primal for many fire Spells).

### Arcane

Arcane magic is the invisible energy that permeates through all of existence, surrounding and connecting every part of the universe. It is a pure, formless energy that can be shaped through study, focus, and discipline. Many mortals learn to harness this power by mastering incantations, runes, and rituals that channel raw magic into structured, purposeful spells.

### Divine

Divine magic draws power from divine beings (good, evil, and indifferent), such as deities (greater and lesser gods), their followers (angels, archons, etc.). or the manifestations of abstract universal concepts (order, love, peace, war, etc.). Divine magic is granted to mortals either through faith, duty, or desperation. Creatures that wield Divine magic are often servants of their deity, seeking to fulfill their agendas and grow their following.

### Primal

Primal magic draws power from the physical forces of the universe (land, air, water, fire, plants, animals, and even the planes themselves). This magic comes from a deep rooted connection to the living essence of the world and its elemental energies. Those who wield Primal magic channel the wild rhythms of existence itself; storms, beasts, natural disasters, and the oceans.

## Schools of Magic

Schools of Magic define the lore and philosophy behind different magical effects. A School of Magic serves as a way to classify magical effects by answering two key questions: what kind of action is the spell performing (such as creating, summoning, altering, or destroying) and the subject it's being performed on (such as the elements, time, or a creature's body, mind, or spirit). This structure helps mages, priests, and sages study, understand, and organize the many forms of magic that shape the world.

### Astromancy

Astromancy is the magic of space, time, and gravity. Spells that alter gravity (reversing, decreasing, or increasing gravity), teleport objects or creatures (directly or through portals), or alter the flow of time (reversing, slowing, speeding, or stopping) fall into the School of Astromancy.

**Common Spell Tags:** Gravity, Motion, Teleportation, Time, Planes.

### Conjuration

Conjuration is the magic of summoning things from one place to another or fabricating something from nothing. Spells that summon creatures, create objects, or illusions in the environment fall into the School of Conjuration.

**Common Spell Tags:** Earth, Illusion, Light, Scent, Sound, Summoning, Weapon.

### Divination

Divination is the magic of revealing the unknown and the unseen, such as hidden knowledge (past, present, or future) and special vision (the invisible, the illusory, or distant locations). Spells that grant magical sight, bestow knowledge, or discern the truth fall into the School of Divination.

**Common Spell Tags:** Communication, Emotions, Knowledge, Sense, Thoughts.

### Elemental

Elemental is the magic of the natural elements, such as earth, wind, fire, water, lightning, and corrosion. Spells that produce effects that manipulate the elementals fall into the School of Elemental.

**Common Spell Tags:** Air, Corrosion, Earth, Fire, Lightning, Water.

### Enchantment

Enchantment is the magic of influencing other creatures' minds, such as provoking strong emotions and mental domination. Spells that create illusions in a creature's mind or charm other creatures through fabricated terror, loyalty, or love fall into the School of Enchantment.

**Common Spell Tags:** Embolden, Emotions, Illusion, Psychic, Sense, Thoughts.

### Invocation

Invocation is the magic of positive energy, such as light, life, healing, and resurrection. Spells that create light, mend wounds, cure sicknesses, create spirits, or resurrect the dead fall into the School of Invocation.

**Common Spell Tags:** Cleansing, Healing, Light, Radiant, Resurrection, Spirit.

### Nullification

Nullification is the magic of negative energy, such as antimagic, anti-life, and darkness. Spells that destroy magic, spirits, and light fall into the School of Nullification.

**Common Spell Tags:** Anti-Magic, Shadow, Spirit, Umbral.

### Transmutation

Transmutation is the magic of transforming one thing physically into another. Spells that turn creatures into other creatures (or objects into other objects or creatures) fall into the School of Transmutation.

**Common Spell Tags:** Earth, Embolden, Metamorphosis, Motion, Sense, Weapon.

## Spell Tags

Spell Tags describe the characteristics of a spell. Some Tags represent clear in-world effects (such as manipulating fire), while others exist mainly to support game mechanics (such as a type of creature the Spell can target). Spell Tags define how a Spell interacts with the game system, such as the damage it deals, the Conditions it inflicts, or the creatures it affects. Certain Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents reference specific Spell Tags, allowing characters to specialize in particular types of magic (such as Fire, Illusion, or Summoning). Spell Tags help players and GMs quickly understand a Spell's function, theme, and how it interacts with other parts of the game.

During a Spell Duel, the creature casting the Spell is referred to as the **Caster** and the opposing creature is referred to as the **Challenger**.

If multiple creatures attempt to initiate a Spell Duel, one of them must be chosen as the **Challenger**, while the others assist them through **Combo Casting**. Additional creatures can also choose to assist the Caster when a Spell Duel is initiated (see Combo Casting for more information).

**Trigger:** You see an MP Effect being cast, provided the Caster or a target is within 5 Spaces of you.

**Reaction:** You can spend an amount of AP and 1 or more MP (up to your Mana Spend Limit) to attempt to stop the Caster's MP Effect. The amount of AP spent is equal to the base AP cost of the MP Effect you're trying to stop.

**Contest:** Make a Spell Check contested by the Spell Check or Spell Attack that the Caster makes to cast their MP Effect. If the Caster's MP Effect doesn't require a Check, they have to make a Spell Check as a Reaction as part of the Spell Duel. For the purposes of the Spell Duel, the Caster and Challenger each gain a bonus to their Check equal to twice the MP spent they spent respectively.

**Beta Note:** Since enemies don't have MP costs for their MP Effects, you can assume their MP Effects cost an amount of MP equal to half their Level (rounded up).

**Outcomes:**

- **Success:** The Caster's MP Effect fails and has no effect.
- **Failure:** The Caster's MP Effect succeeds and takes effect. The Check bonus gained from MP spent doesn't apply to the MP Effect's Success and Failure Statements.
- **Tie:** The Caster's MP Effect fails, has no effect, and you each roll on the Wild Magic Surge Table. The effect from the table lasts until 1 Round has passed.

**Resources Lost:** Whatever the result, each creature still spends all AP, MP, or other resources as normal.

**Example:** A Caster makes an MP based Spell Attack and a Challenger attempts to stop it. The Caster's Spell Attack cost 1 AP and 2 MP. The Challenger must spend 1 AP and at least 1 MP to attempt to stop the Spell Attack. The Caster makes an Attack Check (since its a Spell Attack) and the Challenger makes a Spell Check. The Caster gets a +4 bonus to their Attack Check (2 MP spent) and the Challenger gets a +2 bonus to their Spell Check (1 MP spent). Should the Caster win the Contest, their MP Effect takes effect but they don't include the +4 bonus from MP spent to determine if they score a Heavy Hit or higher.

## Combo Spellcasting

**Prerequisite:** Spellcasting Path

During a Combo Casting, the creature casting the MP Effect is referred to as the **Caster** while the other creatures assisting are called **Participants**.

**Trigger:** You can see an MP Effect you know being cast or a Spell Duel being initiated, provided the MP Effect's Caster or at least 1 of its target are within 5 Spaces of you.

**Reaction:** You can spend an amount of AP equal to the base AP cost of the MP Effect you are trying to assist (or stop in the case of a Spell Duel). When you do, the MP Effect gains a +2 bonus to its Check and Save DC for this turn. If you're participating in a Spell Duel, the Challenger you are helping gains this bonus to their Check to determine the winner of the Contest.

**Spending MP:** You can choose to spend 1 or more MP to add MP Enhancements to the Caster's MP Effect. The total MP spent on the MP Effect can't exceed the Caster's Mana Spend Limit.

**Example:** Casters A & B each have a Mana Spend Limit of 3. Caster A spends 1 AP and 3 MP to cast the Fire Bolt Spell. Caster B can spend 1 AP and 3 MP as a Reaction to add 3 MP worth of MP Enhancements to Caster A's Spell. Caster A then gains a +2 bonus to their Spell Attack and Save DC for that Spell.

# CHAPTER 3: General Rules

## Environment

## Spaces & Distance

Distance is measured using Spaces, like the Spaces on a Grid Map. A Space can be measured in feet or meters, where 1 Space is equal to 5 feet or 1.5 meters.

**DC Tip:** 1 Foot is roughly 30 Centimeters, so you can quickly convert from Feet to Centimeters by multiplying the number of Feet by 30.

**Grid Map Distance:** When moving or measuring distance on a gridded map, moving in any direction counts as 1 Space (including moving diagonally). You can alternatively measure in straight lines between points if you have the measuring tools or templates to do so.

**Example:** The normal range of a Longbow is 30 Spaces. To determine its range on a Grid Map just count 30 Spaces in any direction. The Longbow's range could also be expressed as 150ft or 45m.

When tracking distance across long distances, such as from one town to another, you might want to measure distance using feet or meters instead.

**DC Tip:** Using Spaces to track distance in Combat makes things easier for determining how far a creature can move or the range of an effect. If something has a range of 10 Spaces, then that's 10 Spaces on the Grid Map.

## Difficult Terrain

Some terrain is more difficult to move through due to obstacles in the way (such as plants, rocks, fallen debris, other creatures, etc.). This type of terrain is more difficult to traverse than normal.

While moving through Difficult Terrain, you are **Slowed** (every 1 Space moved costs 2 Spaces of movement).

## Jumping

Jumping is a form of movement. A creature must have means of gaining movement in order to perform a jump. If a creature does not have enough movement to jump the maximum distance possible, its jump distance is shortened to the maximum movement available.

There are two types of jumps: a **Long Jump** and a **High Jump**. A Long Jump represents the distance a creature can move while jumping horizontally, and a High jump represents the distance a creature's feet can reach above the ground when jumping vertically.

## Jump Distance

A creature's Jump Distance is equal to its Agility (minimum of 1).

**Jump Distance = Agility**

**Running Jump:** After moving at least 2 Spaces, a creature can perform a Long Jump (horizontal jump) or a High Jump (vertical jump). If performing a Long Jump, it can jump its Jump Distance in Spaces. If performing a High Jump, it can jump its Jump Distance in feet (1ft = 30cm).

**Standing Jump:** A creature can forgo moving at least 2 Spaces before performing a jump, however its maximum Jump Distance is halved for the jump.

### Long Jump

**Long Jump = Jump Distance (in Spaces)**

**Long Jump Example:** A creature has a Jump Distance of 3. If that creature takes the Move Action to gain 4 Spaces of movement, it can move 2 Spaces before performing a Long Jump that can cover up to 2 Spaces (Jump Distance). It would need to take the Move Action again (gaining 4 more Spaces of movement) to have enough movement to jump the full 3 Spaces possible.

**DC Tip:** If you had a Jump Distance of 5 that doesn't mean that when you jump, you automatically jump 5 Spaces (that would be broken). Jump Distance is the number of Spaces you can cover in a single jump. You need to have enough movement (from taking the Move Action, etc.) to cover that distance.

### High Jump

**High Jump = Jump Distance (in feet)**

**High Jump Example:** A creature has a Jump Distance of 3. If that creature takes the Move Action to gain 4 Spaces of movement, it can move 2 Spaces to perform a High Jump that can reach up to 3ft (90cm) above the ground.

### Vertical Reach

The maximum height a creature can reach with its arms is equal to 1.5 times its height. A creature with a height of 6ft (1.8m) can reach something 9ft (2.7m) above the ground with its arms. A creature's vertical reach is added to its High Jump when determining how high it can reach during the jump.

## Falling

**Falling Damage:** When a creature falls from a height more than its Agility in Spaces (minimum of 1 Space) and collides with the ground, an object, or a creature it takes Bludgeoning damage equal to the number of Spaces it fell (up to a maximum of 100 damage) and falls **Prone**.

**Reduced Impact:** A creature that's going to take damage from Falling can make an Agility Save. The DC equals 10 + 1 per each Space it falls. **Success:** It reduces the damage by an amount equal to its Agility (minimum of 0) and doesn't fall **Prone**.

**Example:** If a PC has an Agility of 1 and falls from a height of 1 Spaces, they take no damage and don't fall **Prone**. If a PC has an Agility of 1 and falls from a height of 2 Spaces, they can make a DC 12 (10 + a 2 Space Fall) Agility Save, and on a **Success** they take 1 damage (2 Space Fall - 1 Agility = 1 damage) and don't fall **Prone**. On a **Failure**, they take 2 damage and fall **Prone**.

**Falling Collision:** All targets the creature collides with share an amount of Bludgeoning damage equal to half the number of Spaces the creature fell and fall **Prone**. If a target is a creature, they can make an Physical Save to avoid falling **Prone**. The DC equals 10 + the damage taken.

**Example:** A Huge sized creature falls 10 Spaces and then collides with two Medium sized creatures. The Huge creature takes 10 Bludgeoning damage from falling and falls **Prone** (can attempt a DC 10 Agility Save to reduce the damage by its Agility and avoid falling **Prone**). The two Medium creatures share 5 damage, each take 3 Bludgeoning damage (5 damage ÷ 2 creatures = 2.5, rounded up to 3) and both fall **Prone** (each can attempt a DC 13 Physical Save to avoid falling **Prone**).

## Controlled Falling

If you are falling intentionally and are in control of your body and movement, it is considered a Controlled Fall. There are no additional penalties to falling in this way.

## Uncontrolled Falling

If you are thrown off a ledge, knocked back from an explosion, unable to react, or restrained in some way, it is considered an Uncontrolled Fall (GM discretion).

**Uncontrolled Impact:** If you are uncontrollably falling, the DC of Reduced Impact increases by 5. Additionally, you take damage when falling from any height (regardless of your Agility).

**Example:** If a PC has an Agility of 3 and has a Controlled Fall from a height of 3 Spaces, they can make a DC 13 Acrobatics Check, and on a **Success** they take 0 damage (3 Space Fall - 3 Agility = 0 damage). If that same PC has an Uncontrolled Fall from a height of 3 Spaces, they would make a DC 18 (DC 13 + 5) Acrobatics Check instead.

## Continuous Falling

If you're still falling at the end of your turn, you immediately fall another 100 Spaces.

## Falling While Flying

If you are knocked **Prone** while flying, you immediately fall up to 100 Spaces unless you are magically held aloft. If you are still falling at the start of your turn, you can spend 2 Spaces of movement to end the **Prone** Condition on yourself (as if standing up in mid air).

## Climbing

Creatures that lack a Climb Speed are **Slowed 1** while climbing. A creature can climb a ladder, a knotted rope, or along a pocketed wall without requiring a Climbing Check (Athletics). Climbing a slick rope or wall may require a Climbing Check. Creatures with a Climb Speed have ADV on Climbing Checks. The table below provides guidance on setting the DC for challenging climbs. **Failure:** The creature immediately falls.

| Difficulty    | DC 10 |
| :------------ | :---- |
| Soft or Mushy | +5    |
| Wet or Icy    | +5    |
| Flat          | +10   |
| Upside Down   | +10   |

**DC Tip:** Climbing great distances can be challenging, so the GM may ask a PC to make a DC 10 Climbing Check for every additional 4 Spaces they climb beyond the first 4 Spaces, even if the rope or surface is normally easy to climb short distances. Creatures with Climbing Speeds wouldn't need to make these Checks.

## Swimming

Creatures that lack a Swim Speed are **Slowed 1** while swimming. A creature can swim for 20 Spaces (100ft / 30m) in still waters without requiring a Swimming Check (Athletics). Swimming in a turbulent body of water without a Swim Speed requires a Swimming Check. The table below provides guidance on setting the DC for challenging swims. **Failure:** The creature fails to move and sinks 2 Spaces into the body of water.

| Difficulty | DC 10 |
| :--------- | :---- |
| Choppy     | +5    |
| Icy        | +5    |
| Swampy     | +5    |
| Stormy     | +10   |

**DC Tip:** Swimming great distances can be challenging, so the GM may ask a PC to make a DC 10 Swimming Check for every additional 20 Spaces they swim beyond the first 20 Spaces, even if the water is still. Creatures with Swimming Speeds wouldn't need to make these Checks.

## Holding Your Breath

Creatures that require air to breathe can hold their breath to avoid breathing in toxic air, drowning underwater, or suffocating in an airless vacuum. A creature that can no longer hold its breath begins **Suffocating**. The amount of time a creature can hold its breath depends on the type of stress they are exposed to and energy they're exerting.

There are two types of measures to hold your breath: a **Calm Hold** and a **Stressed Hold**. A Calm Hold represents the duration a creature can hold its breath while in a low stress environment while doing little to no activity, and a Stressed Hold represents the time a creature can hold its breath while in a high stress environment while doing lots of activity.

## Breath Duration

A creature's Breath Duration is equal to its Might (minimum of 1).

**Breath Duration = Might**

### Calm Hold

**Calm Hold = Breath Duration (in minutes)**

A creature that is performing No Activity or Light Activity in a calm environment can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to its Breath Duration. If a creature begins performing any Strenuous Activity or Dangerous Activity, any remaining minutes of air is converted to an equal number of rounds.

**Calm Hold Example:** A creature has a Breath Duration of 3. If that creature decides to hold its breath while standing still in a calm environment, it can hold its breath for up to 3 minutes.

- **No Activity:** Lying down, meditating, or contemplating while idle.
- **Light Activity:** Non-strenuous activity that requires little effort, such as reading, bandaging wounds, and standing watch.

### Stressed Hold

**Stressed Hold = Breath Duration (in rounds)**

A creature that is performing Strenuous Activity or Dangerous Activity can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to its Breath Duration.

**Stressed Hold Example:** A creature has a Breath Duration of 3. If that creature decides to hold its breath while fighting a sea monster underwater, it can hold its breath for up to 3 rounds or 36 seconds (1 round is 12 seconds).

- **Strenuous Activity:** Any activity that requires physical exertion, such as traveling, foraging, exercising, training, or casting Spells.
- **Dangerous Activity:** Any activity that causes extreme injury or stress, such as engaging in combat with a hostile creature.

**DC Tip:** Remember, 1 Round in Combat is 12 seconds. That means that 1 minute is equal to 5 Rounds of Combat.

## Losing Your Breath

**Speaking:** Creatures that attempt to speak while holding their breath, such as to satisfy the Verbal Component required to cast a Spell, reduce their Breath Duration by 1.

**Knocking the Wind Out:** Whenever you take damage, you must make a Might Save. The DC equals 10 or twice the damage taken (whichever is higher). **Failure:** You lose 1 round of air.

**DC Tip:** Certain effects and abilities can cause a creature to begin Suffocating immediately, usually by knocking the air out of a creature or by constricting it.

## Suffocating

At the start of each of your turns, you suffer the following effects while you're **Suffocating**:

- **Loss of Consciousness:** You must make a DC 10 Might Save. **Failure:** You fall **Unconscious**. **Success:** You remain conscious, but the DC increases by 5.
- **HP Reduction:** You take an amount of True damage equal to 1/4 your Maximum HP.

These effects can't be reversed by any means until you regain the ability to breathe again.

## Vision

## Line of Sight

Line of Sight refers to a creature being able to see something within their field of view. If a PC watches a creature run behind a castle wall, that creature is no longer in the PC's Line of Sight.

On a grid map, this would mean that you can draw a straight line from any one corner of the Space that you're on to any one corner of a Space that the other creature is on. If you can see a creature but they're partially behind something (a wall, another creature, etc.), then they have **Cover** (see below).

## Cover

**1/2 Cover:** Creatures have a -2 penalty on Attack Checks and Spell Checks against a target's PD or AD while the target is behind 1/2 Cover.

A creature benefits from 1/2 Cover when it's hiding behind a chair, a small table, or another creature of the same size or larger.

**3/4 Cover:** Creatures have a -5 penalty on Attack Checks and Spell Checks against a target's PD or AD while the target is behind 3/4 Cover.

A creature benefits from 3/4 Cover when it's hiding behind a large piece of furniture, a creature 2 sizes larger than it or larger, or partially covered by a wall.

**Full Cover:** Creatures can't make Attack Checks or Spell Checks against a target's PD or AD while the target is behind Full Cover.

A creature benefits from Full Cover when it's completely behind an object that is larger than it.

**Illustration:** The image below illustrates how Line of Sight and Cover work in DC20. Player A would have No Cover, Player B would have 1/2 Cover, Player C would have 3/4 Cover and Player D has Full Cover from the Enemy.

## Concealment

**Partially Concealed:** A creature is Partially Concealed while within an area of thin fog, moderate foliage, or Dim Light. Creatures have DisADV on Awareness Checks made to see things that are Partially Concealed.

**Fully Concealed:** A creature is Fully Concealed while in an area that blocks vision entirely, such as Darkness, thick fog, or dense foliage. Creatures are considered **Blinded** for the purposes of seeing things that are Fully Concealed.

## Illumination

The illumination of an area can effect a creature's ability to see. There are 3 levels of illumination: **Bright Light**, **Dim Light**, and **Darkness**. Unless otherwise stated, this book assumes all creatures are in an area of Bright Light.

Anytime a source of light produces Bright Light with a listed radius, then that source of light also produces Dim Light that extends out an equal distance beyond the Bright Light. Beyond the radius of Dim Light is only Darkness, unless there is another source of light illuminating the area.

**Example:** If a campfire produces Bright Light with a 5 Space radius, then it also produces Dim Light with a 5 Space radius. The result is that the campfire produces 5 Spaces of Bright Light followed by another 5 Spaces of Dim Light in all directions.

### Bright Light

Bright Light fully illuminates everything within its area, allowing creatures to see normally. Most sources of mundane fire produces an area of Bright Light, such as torches, lanterns, or campfires.

**Sunlight:** Sunlight is a special form of Bright Light that illuminates the land while the sun is present in the sky. Some creatures, such as Vampires, suffer penalties while in an area of Sunlight.

### Dim Light

Dim Light only partially illuminates an area, allowing creatures to see with difficulty. Dim Light fills the area between the boundaries of Bright Light and Darkness. The area covered by a shadow, the light of a full moon, and the light produced by dusk and dawn are all examples of Dim Light.

**Seeing in Dim Light:** Unless a creature has Darkvision or another means to see normally in Dim Light, they perceive things within Dim Light as Partially Concealed (DisADV on Awareness Checks to see them).

**Example:** A creature carries a torch that sheds 3 Spaces of Bright Light followed by another 3 Spaces of Dim Light in all directions. The creature can see things within the Bright Light normally, making Awareness Checks as called for by the GM. However, the creature has DisADV on any Awareness Checks it makes to see things that are within the Dim Light.

### Darkness

Darkness is an area that lacks any form of illumination, making it impossible for creatures to see. Nighttime between dusk and dawn, an unlit room, or an underground tunnel are examples of Darkness.

**Seeing in Darkness:** Unless a creature has Darkvision or another means to see partially or normally in Darkness, they perceive things within Darkness as Fully Concealed (**Blinded** to see them). While in an area of Darkness, a creature can't see anything within the area, but it can still see areas of Dim Light or Bright Light that are within its Line of Sight.

**Example:** A creature is in an area of Darkness that extends in all directions as far the horizon, making them unable to see anything at all, including themself. However, if a source of light were produced somewhere within the creature's Line of Sight (such as a distant campfire), the creature would remain **Blinded** to all things except that area of illumination (whether Dim Light or Bright Light).

## Magical Light & Darkness

There are also sources of Magical Light and Magical Darkness coming out in the Beta.

## Vision

### Darkvision

Creatures with Darkvision have the ability see in Dim Light and Darkness out to a specified range. A creature with Darkvision can see areas of Dim Light within the specified range as if it were Bright Light, and see areas of Darkness within the specified range as if it were Dim Light. A creature can't discern color using their Darkvision, only shades of grey.

**Example:** A creature with Darkvision 10 can see up to 10 Spaces in Dim Light as if it were Bright Light, and up to 10 Spaces in Darkness as if it were Dim Light.

### Tremorsense

Creatures with Tremorsense can sense vibrations in the ground within a specified range, allowing them to automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the same surface, including through Cover and Concealment.

Creatures with Tremorsense and a Swim Speed can also pinpoint the location of creatures moving through water within the specified range.

### Blindsight

Creatures with Blindsight have the ability to see things within a specified range without the use of eyes. Creatures without eyes or that can see using echolocation are able to see things using Blindsight. A creature with Blindsight is immune to being **Blinded**, can see things that are **Invisible**, and can see unimpeded by Concealment. Blindsight doesn't grant a creature the ability to see behind Cover.

**Example:** A creature with Blindsight 5 can see up to 5 Spaces in any direction as if they could see normally. This includes **Invisible** creatures within range and creatures that are Partially or Fully Concealed within range that aren't behind Cover.

### Truesight

Creatures with Truesight have the ability to see things that are normally imperceptible out to a specified range. They can see through normal and magical Darkness, see into the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane (and vice versa), see things that are **Invisible**, automatically see through illusions, and can perceive the true form of a Shapechanger or creature that is transformed by magic.

**Example:** A creature with Truesight 10 can see up to 10 Spaces in Darkness normally, see creatures within range that are **Invisible** or on the Ethereal Plane, and see the true form of a any creature that is shapeshifted.

## Areas of Effect

An Area of Effect represents a zone of some kind that an effect covers, such as an **Arc**, **Aura**, **Cone**, **Line**, **Ring**, **Sphere**, or **Zone**.

**Point of Origin:** The Point of Origin for an Area of Effect is always 1 Space from which it extends (Arc, Cone, Line, or Wall) or is centered on (Aura, Ring, or Sphere). If the Area of Effect can't be centered on 1 Space then it's instead centered on the 4 most center Spaces.

**Example:** On a Grid Map, a 3 Space diameter Sphere is 3 Spaces wide where the center of that Sphere is 1 Space. Alternatively, a 6 Space diameter Sphere is 6 Spaces wide where the center of that Sphere is the center most 4 Spaces. This is because there isn't only 1 Space that sits directly in its center.

### Arc

An Arc forms a near half circle. An Arc's size is expressed as a radius in Spaces that extends in a 180° arc from the Point of Origin in a direction of your choice. The height of an Arc is 1 Space. An Arc's Point of Origin isn't included in its Area of Effect.

### Aura

An Aura's size specifies its radius in Spaces. An Aura extends in a straight line in all directions from a creature or object, but not through Full Cover, and moves with it for the duration. The source of the Aura chooses if the Point of Origin is subjected to the Aura's effects.

### Cone

A Cone extends 90° from its Point of Origin in a direction of your choice. A Cone's size specifies its length in Spaces. A Cone gets taller and wider as it gets longer. A Cone's Point of Origin isn't included in the its Area of Effect.

### Line

A Line's size specifies its length in Spaces. A Line is 1 Space tall and wide (unless stated otherwise) and extends from its Point of Origin in a direction of your choice. A Line's Point of Origin isn't included in its Area of Effect.

**Wall:** A Wall is a Line that extends vertically up or down in a specified number of Spaces.

### Ring

A Ring's size specifies its diameter in Spaces. A Ring extends horizontally in all directions horizontally from its Point of Origin, but not through Full Cover. A Ring's area is 1 Space high and only includes the Spaces at the edge of its diameter (not the interior). A Ring's Point of Origin isn't included in its Area of Effect.

**Ringwall:** A Ringwall is a Ring that extends vertically up or down in a specified number of Spaces from the edge of its diameter.

### Sphere

A Sphere's size specifies its diameter in Spaces. A Sphere extends horizontally in all directions from its Point of Origin, but not through Full Cover. A Sphere's Point of Origin is included in its Area of Effect.

**Cylinder:** A Cylinder is a Sphere that extends vertically up or down in a specified number of Spaces from the edge of its diameter.

**Dome:** A Dome is a hollow Sphere that's area only includes the Spaces at the edge of its curved surface (not the interior).

### Zone

A Zone is a series of Spaces connected to each other. Each Space within a Zone must be perpendicularly adjacent to at least 1 other Space of the Zone. A Zone's size specifies its total number of Spaces. A Zone extends from its Point of Origin in a direction of your choice. A Zone's Point of Origin isn't included in its Area of Effect.

## Creatures & Combat

## Creatures

### Creature Sizes

Creatures come in many different shapes and sizes ranging from a miniscule bug to a primordial titan and beyond. The number of Spaces a creature occupies determines its size for the purposes of rules that govern the interactions between creatures and their environment. The table below shows the 9 different creatures sizes with examples for each and the number of Spaces they occupy.

| Size       | Examples     | Spaces                                                                           |
| :--------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Tiny       | Cat          | 1/4 Space (4 per Space)                                                          |
| Small      | Sheep        | 1 Space                                                                          |

| Large      | Horse        | 4 Spaces: (2 x 2) or (4 x 1)                                                     |
| Huge       | Elephant     | 9 Spaces: (3 x 3), (4 x 2), or (9 x 1)                                           |
| Gargantuan | T-Rex        | 16 Spaces: (4 x 4), (5 x 3), (8 x 2), or (16 x 1)                                |
| Colossal   | Brontosaurus | 25 Spaces: (5 x 5), (6 x 4), (8 x 3), (12 x 2), or (25 x 1)                      |
| Titanic    | Blue Whale   | 50 Spaces: (7 x 7), (8 x 6), (10 x 5), (12 x 4), (16 x 3), (25 x 2), or (50 x 1) |

**Micro Creatures:** Exceptionally small creatures, such as ants, can share their Space with other creatures. They can end their turn in a Space occupied by other creatures (and vice versa).

### Moving & Grappling Creatures

Creatures of different sizes have bonuses or penalties when attempting to Grapple, push, move, and knock other creatures **Prone** by mundane means.

| Size                              | Check      |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------- |
| 1 + Sizes larger than the target  | ADV        |
| Same Size as target               | Normal     |
| 1 Size smaller than the target    | DisADV     |
| 2 + Sizes smaller than the target | Impossible |

**Example:** If a Medium sized Champion is trying to move a Large sized creature, the Champion would have DisADV on the Check they make to move it.

### Grappled

You're **Immobilized**.

**Escape Grapple:** You can spend 1 AP to attempt to free yourself from a Grapple. Make a Acrobatics or Athletics Check contested by the Grappler's Athletics Check. **Success:** The Grapple immediately ends.

The Grapple also ends if any of the following occurs:

- **Incapacitated:** The Grappler becomes **Incapacitated**.
- **Falling:** The Grappler is unable to carry your weight when you begin falling, provided they aren't also falling with you.
- **Forced Movement:** An effect forcibly moves you or the Grappler, causing you to move outside the Grappler's reach. If the effect requires a Contested Check or Save, the Grappler makes the Check or Save instead of you. If the effect targets both you and the target, the Grappler makes 1 Check or Save for both of you. **Success:** The targets are not moved. **Failure:** The targets are moved.

**Grappled by Multiple Creatures:** A creature that's Grappled by more than 1 creature only suffers the effects of being Grappled once. However, a creature Grappled by multiple sources will remain Grappled until they're free from being Grappled by all sources.

**Example:** While Grappled, a creature is **Immobilized** (DisADV on Agility Saves). A creature doesn't have DisADV 2 on Agility Saves as a result of being Grappled by 2 creatures. They only have DisADV on Agility Saves.

**Moving the Target:** If multiple creatures are Grappling the same target and one of them tries to move the Grappled target, it must make a Contested Athletics Check against all creatures Grappling the same target. **Success:** It ends the Grapple on the target by all creatures other than itself, allowing it to move the creature as normal.

### Moving Through Creatures

While moving in Combat, there will be times when you'll want or need to move through another creature's Space. Whether the creature is friendly or hostile to you will determine if you can freely move through their Space.

**Friendly Creatures:** You can move through a Space occupied by a friendly creature without having to spend any extra movement.

**Hostile Creatures:** You can move through the Space of hostile creatures that are 2 sizes larger or smaller than you, but you are considered to be **Slowed** while moving through the Space they occupy. If the creature is within 1 size of you, you can't move through its Space unless you take the Pass Through Action (see 'Pass Through' on page 44).

**Ending Your Movement:** You can't end your turn in a Space that's occupied by another creature.

### Collision

When a creature is thrown or knocked back and collides with an immovable object (such as a wall) or another creature, it takes damage upon impact.

**Sudden Stop:** The creature stops in the Space where it made contact with the target of the Collision.

**Collision Damage:** The creature and all targets of the Collision share an amount of Bludgeoning damage equal to the number of Spaces the creature couldn't travel (due to the Collision).

**Example:** A creature is knocked back 5 Spaces and impacts a wall that's only 2 Spaces away. The creature would be thrown 2 Spaces into the wall and then take 3 Bludgeoning damage for the 3 Spaces they couldn't be moved (5-2 = 3). If the creature impacted another creature instead of a wall, they would share the 3 Bludgeoning damage (1.5 damage each, rounded up to 2 damage each).

**Colliding with a Target:** When you forcibly move a creature toward a target, you compare your Check against the target's PD. **Hit:** The forcibly moved creature and the target share the Collision damage (each take half). **Miss:** The forcibly moved creature continues traveling up the maximum distance moved.

### Throwing

You can spend 1 AP to throw an object or a creature you have Grappled.

**Object:** The target is thrown up to a number of Spaces away as shown in the Throwing Table. For the purposes of throwing, your minimum Might is 1. The total distance thrown is halved if thrown vertically.

**Throw at a Target:** When you throw an object at a target it's considered a Ranged Martial Attack with an Improvised Weapon against the target's PD. **Hit:** The target takes 1 damage of a type determined by the GM. **Miss:** The thrown object continues traveling up to your maximum throwing distance.

**DC Tip:** When you throw Weapons (including an Improvised Weapon) that lack the Toss or Thrown Properties as part of an Attack, you make the Attack with DisADV.

**Creature:** Make an Athletics Check against the target's Might Save. **Check Success:** The target is thrown up to a number of Spaces away as shown in the Throwing Table (ending the Grapple). For the purposes of throwing, your minimum Might is 1. The total distance thrown is halved if thrown vertically upward.

**Throw at a Target:** When you throw the creature at a target, you compare your Athletics Check against the target's PD. **Hit:** The thrown creature and the target share the Collision damage (each take half). **Miss:** The thrown creature continues traveling to your maximum throwing distance.

#### Throwing Table

| Size             | Spaces Thrown |
| :--------------- | :------------ |
| 2+ Sizes smaller | 2 x Might     |
| 1 Size smaller   | Might         |
| Same Size        | 1/2 Might     |
| Larger           | Impossible    |

**Example:** A Medium sized creature with a Might of 0 (minimum Might of 1) could throw a Tiny object up to 2 Spaces, a Small object 1 Space, and Medium object 1 Space (rounded up from 0.5). Conversely, if that creature had a Might of 6, they could throw a Tiny object 12 Spaces, a Small object 6 Spaces, and a Medium object 3 Spaces.

**Throwing Melee Weapons:** When you throw a Weapon (or Shield) that lacks the Toss or Thrown Properties, it's considered an Improvised Weapon for the purposes of the Attack. See 'Equipment' on page 133 for more information on Weapon properties.

**DC Tip:** Most Weapons are Tiny objects, so a Medium creature with a Might of 3 could throw a Weapon up to 6 Spaces.

### Improvised Weapons

When an object that's not a Weapon is used as one, it's considered an Improvised Weapon. Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an Improvised Weapons deals 1 damage of a type determined by the GM. When making an Attack with an Improvised Weapon you have DisADV.

**Weapon Style:** Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an Improvised Weapon doesn't benefit from any Weapon Properties or Attack Enhancements granted by a Weapon.

**DC Tip:** If an Improvised Weapon is similar enough to an actual weapon, the GM might decide that it could gain certain Weapon Properties (such as Reach) or even a Weapon's Attack Enhancement (such as Bleed).

### Unarmed Strikes

Unarmed Strikes deal 0 Bludgeoning damage. An Unarmed Strike is a Melee Attack made using any part of a creature's own body, such as a Punch, Elbow, Kick, Knee, or Headbutt.

**DC Tip:** Attacks that deal 0 base damage can still benefit from bonus damage, such as Heavy Hits, Martial Enhancements, Class Features, etc.

### Natural Weapons

A Natural Weapon is a part of a creature's body that counts as a Weapon (such as a Claws, Fangs, and Horns). When you Attack with a Natural Weapon it's considered both a Weapon Attack and an Unarmed Strike.

**Wielding a Natural Weapon:** A Natural Weapon is considered to be wielded by the appendage it's attached to unless that appendage is holding something.

**Example:** A Beastborn with claws is considered to be wielding the claws in their hands, qualifying these Natural Weapons for Dual Wielding and similar mechanics.

### Non-Lethal Attacks

When you make a Melee Attack with a Weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can declare the Attack to be Non-Lethal. If a creature is reduced to 0 HP or lower by a Non-Lethal Attack, they are knocked **Unconscious** instead and are considered Stable for the purposes of Death's Door.

If a creature is knocked **Unconscious** in this way, another creature can spend 1 AP to shake them awake. When the creature awakens, they are on Death's Door at 0 HP, regardless of how much damage was dealt by the Non-Lethal Attack.

### Dual Wielding

You're considered to be Dual Wielding when you're wielding a separate Weapon in each hand. When you make an Attack with one of the Weapons you're Dual Wielding, your next Attack on this turn with the other Weapon ignores the Multiple Check Penalty (and doesn't advance that penalty), provided you're still Dual Wielding those Weapons. You can only do this once on each of your turns.

**DC Tip:** If one of your hands is a Natural Weapon (such as a Claw or the Monk's Iron Palm benefit), it counts as a Weapon you are wielding in that hand for the purposes of Dual Wielding.

### Flanking

You gain an additional +2 to your Melee Attack if the target is Flanked. A creature is Flanked when it has 2 or more enemies within 1 Space of it that are not adjacent to each other, provided they aren't **Incapacitated** or **Prone**. You're considered to be Flanking a creature if you are one of the creatures causing it to be Flanked.

### Prone

While **Prone**, you're subjected to the following effects:

- You have DisADV on Attacks, Ranged Attacks have DisADV against you, and Melee Attacks against you have ADV.
- **Crawl Speed:** Until you stand up, your only movement option is to Crawl, which costs an extra 1 Space of movement for every Space moved.

**Ending Prone:** You can end being **Prone** by spending 2 Spaces of movement to stand up.

**Prone in the Air:** When you become **Prone**, you immediately enter an Uncontrolled Fall unless you're supported by a solid surface (see 'Falling' on page 122 for more information).

### Hidden Creatures

Creatures that are Unseen or Unheard are more difficult to discover.

**Unseen:** You are Unseen by a creature while you're imperceivable to its visual senses, such as when you're Fully Concealed, you're **Invisible**, or it's **Blinded**. While Unseen, you're subjected to the following effects:

- You have ADV on Attacks against creatures that can't see you.
- Creatures that can't see you have DisADV on Attacks against you.

**DC Tip:** If you are Unseen because you're behind Full Cover, effected by the Invisibility Spell, and your target is Blinded, you don't gain the benefits of being Unseen multiple times. You are either Unseen or not.

**Unheard:** You are Unheard while you remain silent, talk no louder than a whisper, or are within an area effected by the Muffle Spell or a similar effect. While Unheard, you're subjected to the following effects:

- You have ADV on Attacks against creatures you're Flanking that can't hear you.

**DC Tip:** If you're Unheard because you're remaining silent or within an area effected by the Muffle Spell, you don't gain the benefits of being Unheard multiple times. You're either Unheard or not.

**Hidden:** You are Hidden from a creature while you are both Unseen and Unheard by it. Your location is unknown to creatures you're Hidden from.

**DC Tip:** If you become Hidden to a creature that's aware of you, it only knows your last location known to it before you became Hidden. Creatures that can detect your presence, even through magical means such as divination, are not considered to know your location, to see you, or to hear you unless the Feature says otherwise.

### Underwater Combat

While underwater, creatures are subjected to the following conditions:

**Attack Penalties:** Martial Attacks are made with DisADV unless the Creature has a Swim Speed. Additionally, Ranged Attacks automatically miss targets beyond the Weapon's normal range.

**Holding Breath:** Creatures that attempt to speak while holding their breath underwater, such as to satisfy the Verbal Component required to cast a Spell, reduce their Breath Duration by 1 (see 'Holding Your Breath' on page 123 for more information).

**Fire Resistance:** Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have Fire Resistance (Half) and are immune to **Burning**.

## Equipment

### Weapons

Every Weapon has a Weapon Type (Melee or Ranged), a Weapon Style (Axe, Sword, Hammer, etc.), and Weapon Properties (Reach, Thrown, Two-Handed, etc.).

## Weapon Types

There are 2 types of Weapons: **Melee Weapons** and **Ranged Weapons**.

### Melee Weapons

Melee Weapons use your Melee Range (see 'Melee Attack' on page 31).

### Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons have a Range of 15/45 (see 'Ranged Attack' on page 31).

**DC Tip:** A Weapon with the Long-Ranged Property has a Range of 30/90.

## Wielding a Weapon

A Weapon requires 1 hand when you Attack with it, unless it has the Two-Handed Property (requires 2 hands to Attack).

**Throwing Weapons:** When you throw a Weapon that lacks the Toss or Thrown Properties, the Weapon is considered an Improvised Weapon for the purposes of the Attack. See 'Throwing Melee Weapons' on page 130 for more information.

## Weapon Styles

Each Weapon Style listed below possesses a **Weapon Enhancement** that defines their unique combat applications and flair. When a PC with Weapon Training makes an Attack with a Weapon, they can spend 1 AP or 1 SP to use its Weapon Enhancement.

### Axe

**Bleed:** The target makes a Repeated Physical Save. **Failure:** The target begins **Bleeding**.

### Bow

**Slow:** The target makes an Agility Save. **Failure:** The target is **Slowed** until the end of its next turn.

### Crossbow

**Accuracy:** You add a d4 to your Attack Check.

### Fist

Fist Weapons are considered to be a free hand for the purposes of **Grappling**.

**Grapple:** The target makes a Physical Save. **Failure:** The target becomes **Grappled** by you.

### Hammer

**Knockback:** The target makes a Might Save. **Failure:** The target is pushed 1 Space away. Each time you use this Enhancement, the target is pushed 1 additional Space.

### Pick

**Hinder:** The target makes an Agility Save. **Failure:** The target becomes **Hindered** until the end of their next turn.

### Sling

**Hinder:** The target makes an Agility Save. **Failure:** The target becomes **Hindered** until the end of their next turn.

### Spear

**Slow:** The target makes an Agility Save. **Failure:** The target becomes **Slowed** until the end of their next turn.

### Staff

**Trip:** The target makes a Physical Save. **Failure:** The target falls **Prone**.

### Sword

**Accuracy:** You add a d4 to your Attack Check.

### Whip

**Pull:** The target makes a Might Save. **Failure:** The target is moved horizontally 1 Space toward you or to your left or right. Each time you use this Enhancement, the target is moved 1 additional Space.

### Lacking Weapon Training

While wielding a Weapon you lack Training with, you can't use its Weapon Enhancement.

## Weapon Properties

Weapons have certain properties that grant them different benefits or drawbacks.

- **Ammo:** This Weapon requires ammunition to make Attacks. You can load a Weapon as part of an Attack made with it.
- **Concealable:** Drawing the Weapon doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks. If you draw the Weapon as part of an Attack, you have ADV on the Attack. You can only gain this benefit once against each creature per Combat.
- **Cumbersome:** It takes 1 AP to draw, stow, or pick up this Weapon.
- **Deft:** Ranged Attacks with this Weapon don't have DisADV as a result of you being **Prone**.
- **Guard:** You gain +1 PD while wielding the Weapon.
- **Heavy:** The Weapon's damage increases by 1.
- **Impact:** The Weapon deals +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
- **Long-Ranged:** The Weapon's Range increases to 30/90.
- **Multi-Faceted:** The Weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you can use both Weapon Enhancements and choose which of the Weapon Style damage types it deals.

**Example:** A Halberd has the Axe and Pick weapon styles. When you attack with it, you can choose either Slashing or Piercing damage. You can also spend AP or SP to add either or both of the Bleed and Hinder Weapon Enhancements.

- **Reach:** This Weapon adds 1 Space to your Melee Range when you Attack with it.
- **Reload:** The Weapon's damage increases by 1, but you must spend 1 AP or 1 SP and use a free hand to reload the Weapon. If the Weapon stops being held, it must be loaded again.
- **Silent:** When you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you're Hidden from.

**DC Tip:** You must be both Unseen and Unheard to be Hidden. If you become seen while making the Attack, you are no longer Hidden.

- **Toss:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10). If you throw it further than this range (see 'Throwing' on page 130) it's considered an Improvised Weapon.

**DC Tip:** This uses the Ranged Martial Attack rules where you make a normal attack up to 5 spaces and a DisADV attack up to 10 spaces.

- **Thrown:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (10/20). If you throw it further than this range (see 'Throwing' on page 130) it's considered an Improvised Weapon.
- **Two-Handed:** The Weapon requires 2 hands when you Attack with it.
- **Unwieldy:** You have DisADV on Attacks made with the Weapon against targets within 1 Space of you.
- **Versatile:** This Weapon can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. When you wield the Weapon with 2 hands, you gain a +2 bonus to Hit using it.
- **Returning:** When you Miss a Ranged Attack with the Weapon, it returns to your hand.

## Customized Weapons

You can create your own unique Weapons by following a 3 step process:

1.  Choose the Weapon Type.
2.  Choose the Weapon Style & Damage.
3.  Choose the Weapon Properties.

## Step 1: Weapon Types

There are 2 types of Weapons: **Melee Weapons** and **Ranged Weapons**.

### Melee Weapons

Melee Weapons use your Melee Range (see 'Melee Attack' on page 31) and deal 1 damage.

### Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons have a Range of 15/45 (see 'Ranged Attack' on page 31) and deal 1 damage. Additionally, they automatically gain the following properties: **Ammo** and **Two-Handed**.

## Wielding a Weapon

A Weapon requires 1 hand when you Attack with it, unless it has the Two-Handed Property (requires 2 hands to Attack).

## Step 2: Weapon Style & Damage

Each Weapon Style has a particular damage type (in parentheses) and Weapon Enhancement as shown below:

**DC Tip:** You can only use a Weapon's Enhancement if you have Weapon Training.

## Melee Weapon Styles

### Axe (Slashing)

**Bleed:** The target makes a Repeated Physical Save. **Failure:** The target begin **Bleeding**.

### Fist (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing)

Fist Weapons are considered to be a free hand for the purposes of **Grappling**.

**Grapple:** The target makes a Physical Save. **Failure:** The target becomes **Grappled** by you.

### Hammer (Bludgeoning)

**Knockback:** The target makes a Might Save. **Failure:** The target is pushed 1 Space away. Each time you use this Enhancement, the target is pushed 1 additional Space.

### Pick (Piercing)

**Hinder:** The target makes an Agility Save. **Failure:** The target becomes **Hindered** until the end of their next turn.

### Spear (Piercing)

**Slow:** The target makes an Agility Save. **Failure:** The target becomes **Slowed** until the end of their next turn.

### Staff (Bludgeoning)

**Trip:** The target makes a Physical Save. **Failure:** The target falls **Prone**.

### Sword (Slashing)

**Accuracy:** You grant your Attack a d4 Help Die.

### Whip (Slashing)

**Pull:** The target makes a Might Save. **Failure:** The target is moved horizontally 1 Space toward you or to your left or right. Each time you use this Enhancement, the target is moved 1 additional Space.

## Ranged Weapon Styles

### Bow (Piercing)

**Slow:** The target makes an Agility Save. **Failure:** The target is **Slowed** until the end of its next turn.

### Crossbow (Piercing)

**Accuracy:** You grant your Attack a d4 Help Die.

### Sling (Bludgeoning)

**Hinder:** The target makes an Agility Save. **Failure:** The target becomes **Hindered** until the end of their next turn.

## Changing Damage Type

Each Weapon Style comes with a default damage type (shown above), but you can switch any of these default damage types to a different one (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing).

## Step 3: Weapon Properties

When you pick a Melee or Ranged Weapon during Character Creation (or craft one later), you can grant it 2 points worth of Weapon Properties. You can't grant a Weapon the same Property more than once.

**DC Tip:** The Two-Handed property given to Ranged Weapons doesn't give you an additional property.

## Property Requirements

If a Weapon Property has a requirement, the Weapon must meet that requirement before you can add that Weapon Property to it.

## Melee Weapon Properties

These Weapon Properties are available to Melee Weapons.

- **(1) Concealable:** Drawing the Weapon doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks. If you draw the Weapon as part of an Attack, you have ADV on the Attack. You can only gain this benefit once against each creature per Combat.
- **(1) Guard:** You gain +1 PD while wielding the Weapon.
- **(2) Heavy:** (Requires: Two-Handed Property) The Weapon's damage increases by 1.
- **(1) Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
- **(1) Multi-Faceted:** The Weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you can use both Weapon Enhancements and choose which of the Weapon Style damage types it deals.
- **(1) Reach:** This Weapon adds 1 Space to your Melee Range when you Attack with it.
- **(1) Returning:** (Requires: Toss Property) When you Miss a Ranged Attack with the Weapon, it returns to your hand.

**DC Tip:** When this weapon Hits, it falls to the ground.

- **(1) Silent:** Ranged Attacks made using the Weapon while you are Hidden don't reveal your position to the creatures you're Hidden from.
- **Toss:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10). If you throw it further than this range (see 'Throwing' on page 130) it's considered an Improvised Weapon.

**DC Tip:** This uses the Ranged Martial Attack rules where you make a normal attack up to 5 spaces and a DisADV attack up to 10 spaces.

- **Thrown:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (10/20). If you throw it further than this range (see 'Throwing' on page 130) it's considered an Improvised Weapon.
- **(-1) Two-Handed:** The Weapon requires 2 hands when you Attack with it. Cannot be taken with the Versatile Property.
- **(-1) Unwieldy:** You have DisADV on Attacks made with the weapon against targets within 1 Space of you.
- **(1) Versatile:** This Weapon can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. When you wield the weapon with 2 hands, you gain a +2 bonus to Hit with it. Can't be taken with the Two-Handed Property.

## Ranged Weapon Properties

These Weapon Properties are available to Ranged Weapons. Additionally, you can spend 1 Property to remove the Two-Handed Property.

- **(2) Heavy:** (Requires: Two-Handed Property and Weapon Mastery) The Weapon's damage increases by 1.
- **(1) Deft:** Ranged Attacks with this Weapon don't have DisADV as a result of you being **Prone**.
- **(1) Impact:** The Weapon deals +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
- **(1) Long-Ranged:** The Weapon's Range increases to 30/90.
- **(-1) Cumbersome:** It takes 1 AP to draw, stow, or pick up this Weapon.
- **(1) Multi-Faceted:** The Weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you can use both Weapon Enhancements and choose which of the Weapon Style damage types it deals.
- **(-1) Reload:** The Weapon's damage increases by 1, but you must spend 1 AP or 1 SP and use a free hand to reload the Weapon. If the Weapon stops being held, it must be loaded again.

**DC Tip:** If you want to run a misfire mechanic, any loaded Weapons are at risk of misfiring while stowed.

- **(1) Silent:** When you made a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you're Hidden from.

## Reskinning Weapons

Ultimately the Style and Properties of a Weapon you create are purely mechanical. With approval from your GM you can re-flavor the weapon to look like anything you want. You could make a Weapon that looks like a Sword but uses the Axe Weapon Style. You could also use an Axe Weapon Style on a Ranged Weapon.

**DC Tip:** The visual look of a weapon is just flavor. All similar-looking weapons don't have to function the exact same. Maybe your sword has a serrated edge and that's why you chose the Axe Style.

### Spell Focuses

You must be holding a Spell Focus in a hand to benefit from its Properties. Holding a Spell Focus counts as performing Somatic Components but is still considered noticeably casting a Spell.

## Spell Focus Properties

Spell Focuses have certain properties that grant them different benefits or drawbacks.

- **Channeling:** You gain a +1 bonus to Spell Checks.
- **Close Quarters:** Your Ranged Spell Attacks don't have DisADV if you're within the Melee Range of enemies.
- **Long-Ranged:** Spells you cast with a Range greater than 1 have their range increase by 5 Spaces.
- **Muffled:** Your Verbal Components can only be heard within 5 Spaces of you.
- **Powerful:** Your Spell Attacks deal +1 damage to all targets.
- **Protective:** Your AD increases by 1.
- **Reach:** Spells you cast with a Range of 1 have their range increase by 1 Space.
- **Reactive:** When you are the Challenger or a Participant helping the Challenger in a Spell Duel, they gain ADV on their Check to stop the Spell.
- **Two-Handed:** The Spell Focus requires 2 hands to benefit from its properties.
- **Vicious:** You gain a +1 bonus to hit with Spell Attacks.
- **Warded:** You have MDR.

## Lacking Spell Focus Training

While wielding a Spell Focus you lack Training with, you do not benefit from its properties.

## Customized Focuses

When you pick a Spell Focus during Character Creation (or craft one later), you can grant it 1 point worth of Focus Properties. You can't grant a Focus the same Property more than once.

## Property Requirements

If a Spell Focus Property has a requirement, the Focus must meet that requirement before you can add that Property to it.

## Spell Focus Properties

Spell Focuses have certain properties that grant them different benefits or drawbacks.

- **(1) Channeling:** You gain a +1 bonus to Spell Checks.
- **(1) Close Quarters:** Your Ranged Spell Attacks don't have DisADV if you're within the Melee Range of enemies.

- **(1) Reactive:** When you are the Challenger or a Participant helping the Challenger in a Spell Duel, they gain ADV on their Check to stop the Spell.
- **(-1) Two-Handed:** The Spell Focus requires 2 hands to benefit from its properties.
- **(1) Vicious:** You gain a +1 bonus to hit with Spell Attacks.
- **(1) Warded:** You have MDR.

## Reskinning Spell Focus

Ultimately the Properties of a Spell Focus you create are purely mechanical. With approval from your GM you can re-flavor the Focus to look like anything you want. You could make a Focus that looks like a Wand but has the Warded Property. You can flavor your Two-Handed Spell Focus as two different Spell Focuses in both your hands that work together to create the same effect. The visual look of a Spell Focus is just flavor. All similar-looking Focus don't have to function the exact same.

**DC Tip:** If you have a Two-Handed Spell Focus and reflavor it as being 2 different Focuses that work in tandem, you do not gain its benefits unless both of your hands are holding the Spell Focuses.

### Armor

Wearing Armor can improve your Defense and provide Damage Reduction. Creatures that aren't wearing Armor are considered **Unarmored**.

## Armor Type

There are 2 types of Armor: **Light Armor** and **Heavy Armor**.

### Light Armor

Light Armor is a type of protection worn by most creatures to protect them from injury. Leather coats, padded jackets, and heavy robes are types of Light Armor.

**Non-Metal Armor:** Light Armor can be described to be made of many things but is not made of enough metal to be considered Metal Armor for the purpose of game mechanics (Features, Spells, Weapon effects, etc.) unless otherwise stated.

### Heavy Armor

Heavy Armor is designed with greater attention in protecting the wearer in traditional warfare, requiring extensive combat training to use most effectively. Lamellar, laminar, and plate armor are types of Heavy Armor.

**Metal Armor:** All Heavy Armor is considered to be Metal Armor for the purpose of game mechanics (Features, Spells, Weapon effects, etc.) unless otherwise stated.

**Impactful Unarmed Strikes:** Your Unarmed Strikes deal +1 damage on a Heavy Hits while wearing Heavy Armor.

## Wearing Armor

It takes 1 minute to don or doff Light Armor, or 10 minutes to do the same with Heavy Armor. You gain the benefits of Armor while wearing it.

## Lacking Armor Training

While wearing Armor that you lack Training in, you have DisADV on Attack Checks and Spell Checks.

## Damage Reduction

Some types of Armor grant Physical or Elemental Damage Reduction (see 'Damage Reduction' on page 38 for more information).

## Armor Examples

| Type             | PD  | AD  | PDR  | Speed | Agility Checks |
| :--------------- | :-- | :-- | :--- | :---- | :------------- |

## Customized Shields

When you pick your Shield during Character Creation (or craft one later), you choose for it to be a Light or Heavy Shield and can grant it 2 points worth of Shield Properties available to that Shield type. You can't grant a Shield the same Property more than once, unless otherwise stated.

## Light Shield Properties

These Shield Properties are available to Light Shields.

- **(1) PD Increase:** The Shield's PD Bonus increases by 1.
- **(1) AD Increase:** The Shield's AD Bonus increases by 1.
- **(1) Grasp:** The Shield is considered to be a free hand when **Grappling**, **Reloading** a Weapon, or Attacking with Versatile Weapon.
- **(1) Toss:** You can throw the Shield to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10). If you throw it further than this range (see Throwing Rules) it's considered an Improvised Weapon.

## Heavy Shield Properties

These Shield Properties are available to Heavy Shields.

- **(1) PD Increase:** The Shield's PD Bonus increases by 1. You can take this Property twice.
- **(1) AD Increase:** The Shield's AD Bonus increases by 1. You can take this Property twice.
- **(1) Mounted:** The Shield's PD and AD Bonuses also apply to your Mount's Defenses.
- **(2) PDR:** The Shields grants Physical Damage Reduction.
- **(2) EDR:** The Shield grants Elemental Damage Reduction.
- **(-1) Bulky:** Your Speed is reduced by 1.
- **(-1) Rigid:** You have DisADV on Agility Checks.

### Adventuring Supplies

## Gauntlet

You can purchase Gauntlets from a Blacksmith (or they come automatically with Heavy Armor). Wearing a Gauntlet gives your Unarmed Strikes with that hand the Impact Weapon Property (+1 damage on Heavy Hits).

**Beta Note:** Prices are not set for things like Gauntlets, so a simple 5g should be a good price for now.

## Healing Potions

Healing Potions are crafted to magically heal wounds when consumed. These are small (usually red) vials of liquid that are small doses but potent in healing.

## Healing Potion Levels

Healing Potions have levels to them that increase in potency and cost.

## Healing Potion Level Table

| Level | Healing         | Price |
| :---- | :-------------- | :---- |
| X     | 2 x Level in HP |       |
| 1st   | 2 HP            | 10    |
| 2nd   | 4 HP            | 25    |
| 3rd   | 6 HP            | 40    |
| 4th   | 8 HP            | 60    |
| 5th   | 10 HP           | 100   |

## Medicine Kit

A Medicine Kit can take many forms based on your PC's theme or expression and is full of supplies and tools such as ointments, tinctures, bandages, and other medicinal reagents.

**Uses:** A fully stocked kit contains 5 uses.

**Using A Kit:** You can take the Object Action and spend 1 use of this kit to treat the wounds of a creature within 1 Space, or cure a Poison affecting it.

### Treating a Wound

You treat a creature's wounds. Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. **Success:** Target regains 1 HP. **Success (each 5):** Target regains +1 HP.

**Limited Healing:** Healing from this kit can't restore a creature's HP above its Bloodied threshold.

### Treating a Poison or Disease

You treat one Basic Poison or Disease afflicting the target. Make a Medicine Check against the DC of the effect. **Success:** Target is cured of that Poison or Disease and no longer suffers its effect. **Success (each 5):** The creature regains +1 HP.

**Advanced Poisons:** You can treat one Advanced Poison instead, provided you have its unique additive. One use of that additive is lost every time you attempt to do so.

**Beta Note:** Diseases are still a work in progress. If they're included in adventures or monsters at a later date, these rules will suffice for treating them as if they were poisons, or those materials will detail how a PC could treat presented Diseases.

### Resupplying a Medicine Kit

**Buying Supplies:** The various supplies contained within this kit can be found in most towns and climates. Enough supplies for 1 use can be bought for 5 gold at a general store.

**Gathering Supplies:** You can scavenge from an appropriate climate (GM's discretion) with a DC 15 Survival Check. **Success:** The kit regains 1 use. **Success (each 5):** +1 use.

## Net

You can throw the Net. Make a Martial Check contested by the target's Physical Save. The Net has no effect on creatures that are formless, smaller than Small, or larger than Large. **Save Failure:** The target is **Immobilized** by the Net until it's freed. **Save Failure (5):** The target is also **Restrained** until it's freed. Forced movement doesn't free the target, but teleportation does. A creature can spend 1 AP to make a DC 10 Athletics or Acrobatics Check. **Success:** It can free itself or another creature within its reach.

**DC Tip:** A Medium sized creature can spend 1 AP to throw an Net up to a number of Spaces away equal to twice their Might (a Small sized creature can throw it half as far). For the purposes of throwing, your minimum Might is 1. The total distance thrown is halved if thrown vertically. See 'Throwing' on page 130 for more information.

## Conditions List

### Bleeding X

You take X True damage at the start of each of your turns.

**Ending Bleeding:** All stacks of the Condition end when you're subjected to an effect that restores your HP. Alternatively, a creature can attempt to remove 1 or more stacks of the Condition by taking the Medicine Action.

## Condition Resistance, Immunity, & Vulnerability

Condition Resistance represents a creature's ability to resist being subjected to Conditions, while Condition Vulnerability represents a creature's weakness against them. Whereas Immunity prevents a creature from being affected by it at all. The source of a creature's Condition Resistance, Immunity or Vulnerability can be attained from a Class Feature, Ancestry Trait, Magic Item, Spell, etc.

### Condition Resistance

**Condition Resistance:** You have ADV on Checks and Saves against the Condition.

**Example:** If you had **Charmed Resistance**, you would have ADV on Checks or Saves against being **Charmed**.

### Condition Vulnerability

**Condition Vulnerability:** You have DisADV on Checks and Saves against the Condition.

**Example:** If you had **Taunted Vulnerability**, you would have DisADV on Checks or Saves against being **Taunted**.

## Condition Stacking & Overlapping

Certain Conditions can stack multiple times, increasing the potency of the Condition's effects on the target. Other Conditions overlap, keeping the same potency but becoming more restrictive.

### Stacking Conditions

A target can be affected by a Condition with an X value multiple times. If you gain multiple stacks of the same Condition, you add their X values together. If a stacking Condition doesn't include an X value, the value equals 1.

**Example:** If you were **Exposed** and another effect imposed the **Exposed** Condition on you again, you would become **Exposed 2**, causing Attacks against you to have ADV 2 (roll 3 d20s and take the highest).

**Durations:** When a creature is subjected to the same Condition multiple times but with different durations, it's important to keep track of the source of each Condition so you know when each Condition ends.

**Example:** You might be **Exposed** against the next Attack against you, **Exposed** until the end of your next turn, and **Exposed** for 1 minute, all at the same time. These effects stack, but you need to track them independently to make sure you know how 'Exposed' you currently are.

### Overlapping Conditions

A target can be effected by each of the following Condition multiple times, but the effects of the same Condition don't stack on the target.

#### Charmed

A creature can be **Charmed** by more than 1 creature at a time, each of them gaining ADV on Charisma Checks against the target. However, a creature that Charms a target more than once only gains the effects of the **Charmed** Condition once.

**Example:** A creature doesn't have ADV 2 on Charisma Checks against a target they've Charmed twice. They only have ADV 1 on Charisma Checks against the target.

#### Frightened

A creature can be **Frightened** by more than 1 creature at a time, suffering DisADV on Checks while any source that Frightened it is within its sight and is unable to move toward them. However, a **Frightened** creature only suffers the effects of the **Frightened** Condition once.

**Example:** A creature doesn't have DisADV 2 on Checks while 2 sources that are Frightening it are in sight. They only have DisADV 1 on Checks, regardless of the number of sources in sight.

#### Restrained

A creature that is **Restrained** by more than 1 creature only suffers the effects of the **Restrained** Condition once. However, a creature **Restrained** by multiple sources will remain **Restrained** until they're free from being **Restrained** by all sources.

#### Taunted

A creature that is **Taunted** by multiple creatures does not have DisADV on their Attacks against creatures that Taunted them. They can only move away from any creature that **Taunted** them if they are moving towards another creature that **Taunted** them.

**Example:** If a Goblin is **Taunted** by a Hunter, then later becomes **Taunted** by a Champion, the Goblin can only move away from the Hunter if they are approaching the Champion and can Attack both normally.

#### Terrified

A creature can be **Terrified** by more than 1 source at a time.

**Example:** If a creature is surrounded by multiple sources, they are unable to move and can only take the Dodge Action.

#### Tethered

A creature that is **Tethered** by more than 1 effect, must remain within reach of all the specified Tethers.

**Example:** If a creature is **Tethered** 5 Spaces by one effect, and then **Tethered** 5 Spaces by another effect, it can't move farther than 5 Spaces from either Tether.

### Excluded Conditions

The following Conditions don't stack or overlap in any way: **Blinded**, **Deafened**, **Immobilized**, **Incapacitated**, **Invisible**, **Paralyzed**, **Petrified**, **Surprised**, and **Unconscious**.

## Resting

This happens during Exploration but are specific moments when PCs stop to rest and recover their resources, spend Rest Points, and perform specific Rest Actions. This could be 10 minutes, 1 hour, or 8 hours depending on the type of Rest being taken. These moments can include roleplay and descriptions of what happens, but they're primarily mechanical in nature.

## Rest Terms

**Rest Points:** You have a number of Rest Points equal to your HP maximum.

**No Activity:** Sleeping, meditating, or contemplating while idle.

**Light Activity:** Non-strenuous activity that requires little effort, such as talking, reading, eating, bandaging wounds, light foraging, and standing watch.

**Strenuous Activity:** Any activity that requires physical exertion, such as traveling, hunting, exercising, training, or casting spells.

**Dangerous Activity:** Any activity that causes extreme injury or stress, such as engaging in combat with a hostile creature.

## Types of Rest

### Quick Rest

A period of No Activity or Light Activity that is at least 10 minutes long.

**Quick Rest Benefits:** You can spend 1 or more Rest Points, up to your maximum, at the end of a Quick Rest. When you do, you regain 1 HP per Rest Point spent.

### Short Rest

A period of No Activity or Light Activity that is at least 1 hour long. You can only gain the benefits of 2 Short Rests per 24 hour period.

**Short Rest Benefits:** At any point during a Short Rest, you can spend Rest Points to regain HP following the same rules as a Quick Rest. Some Features regain expended uses when you complete a Short Rest (as listed in the Feature's description).

### Long Rest

A period of 4 hours of Light Activity and 4 hours of No Activity, taken in either order, for a total of 8 hours of resting. If one of the 4 hour periods is interrupted by any amount of Strenuous Activity or Dangerous Activity, you must begin that 4 hour period again. You can only gain the benefits of 1 Long Rest per 24 hour period.

**Long Rest Benefits:** At any point during a Long Rest, you can spend Rest Points to regain HP following the same rules as a Quick Rest.

**Half Long Rest:** At the end of the first 4 hour period of the rest, you gain the benefits of a Short Rest and regain all spent Rest Points.

**DC Tip:** Make sure to spend any unused Rest Points at the beginning of a Long Rest, since you regain all spent Rest Points after the first 4 hours of a Long Rest.

**Complete Long Rest:** At the end of the second 4 hour period of the rest, you gain the full benefits of completing the Long Rest. Some Features regain expended uses when you complete a Long Rest (as listed in the Feature's description), such as regaining all spent MP.

**DC Tip:** You might just want to take a Half Long Rest (4 hour rest) if you only need to regain HP.

**Doomed:** When you complete a Long Rest, you lose all stacks of the **Doomed** Condition.

**Exhaustion:** For each 4 hour period doing No Activity, you lose 1 stack of **Exhaustion**.

If neither of the 4 hour periods are spent doing No Activity, you must make a DC 10 Might Save. **Failure:** You gain **Exhaustion 1** and the DC of this Save now increases by 5 until you complete a Full Rest.

### Full Rest

A 24 hour or longer period (determined by the GM) that is spent in an area of safety, such as a town, where you can eat well, rest, and recover. If the Full Rest is interrupted by any amount of Dangerous Activity you must begin it again.

**Full Rest Benefits:** At the end of a Full Rest, you gain the benefits of a Long Rest and lose all levels of **Exhaustion**. Your GM can determine if the Full Rest also grants additional benefits by choosing from the list below (or make up something that makes more sense in the given situation):

- Gain Temp HP equal to your Prime Modifier, your level, or twice your level.
- Gain ADV on a type of Check, Save, or both for a given period of time (1 day, 1 week, etc.).

## DCs in DC20

## Difficulty Class (DC)

Difficulty Class (DC) is the number that a Game Master sets as the level of difficulty required to be able to succeed in a given situation. Lockpicking a door, climbing a steep mountain, trying to persuade someone to give you something, or even trying to resist a Spell's effect over you all have a DC that needs to be met or exceeded in order to succeed.

You always roll a d20 and add whatever relevant modifiers there are based on what the Game Master asks for. Usually (unless you are attacking something) this is going to be a Check or a Save.

## Setting a DC 'By 5's'

Checks (in general) work on a 'by 5's' system. This helps to stay consistent and fair in a GM's ruling of how difficult something is to accomplish. Below is a chart with a quick reference, and examples are listed below that. These are meant to give Game Masters a foundation to use and players a general expectation to understand. If you want to get more specific, you can set any number you want as the DC.

**DC Tip:** I personally always have Checks be 'by 5's', but when it comes to setting a DC for combat related things I use more specific numbers. Things like the DC of a Trap or the DC of sneaking by a particular creature might be something like 12, or 14, or 17.

| DC  | Task Difficulty |
| :-- | :-------------- |
| 5   | Very Easy       |
| 10  | Moderate        |
| 15  | Hard            |
| 20  | Very Hard       |
| 25  | Extremely Hard  |
| 30  | Near Impossible |

Most DCs that you'll ask for will either be 10, 15, or 20. Once PCs reach higher levels and start trying to accomplish crazier and crazier things, a DC 25 or even 30 might come up.

- **DC 5:** This is a Very Easy DC that probably shouldn't even be asked for and would be easily accomplished by just about anyone, regardless of training. I usually don't ask for a Check if the DC would be 5.
- **DC 10:** This is a Moderate DC that should be doable, especially if you're skilled at the task. Checks that are simple but still have a small chance of failure are a DC 10 for me.
- **DC 15:** This is a Hard DC to hit for those who aren't skilled in this task. If a PC has a decent modifier of a +5 in a Skill, they would have around a 50% chance of success on this. This is my go to DC for when I really don't know if someone can do it or not and is one step beyond the 'moderate' DC of 10.
- **DC 20:** This is a Very Hard DC to hit unless you have training in this Skill. Even PCs with a +10 modifier would hit a DC 20 about 50% of the time. This DC represents something of great worth and something that would be Very Hard.
- **DC 25:** This is an Extremely Hard DC to hit. Even if the PC has a +5 in their Skill, they would still need a Nat 20 to just succeed on this DC. I reserve this for things that would be next to impossible at early levels of play, and would only be possible if the character that was attempting to hit this DC both had a good modifier to the roll and rolled well.
- **DC 30:** This is a Near Impossible DC to hit. It takes a lot for a character to get a +10 in a skill, and even if they did have a +10 they'd still need a Nat 20 to hit this. Reserve this DC for those Checks that are possible for the PC to accomplish, but it'd have to be a 'miracle' for it to happen (see Nat 20 and Nat 1 section below for more tips on when to ask for rolls).

**DC Tip:** The best way I can describe it is this. If I have a little bit of doubt that a PC could do it, the DC is 10. If there is a decent amount of doubt that they could accomplish this, then the DC is 15. If I am very doubtful that the PC could accomplish this, the DC is 20 and they better roll really high!

## Great Success and Failure

With 5 point increments you can dial things up or down based on if they beat the Check by 5 or fail the Check by 5. If the DC for climbing a castle wall is 15, a 15 would exactly succeed, but if they beat it by 5 and got a 20 or higher, maybe something cool happens like the guard at the top doesn't see them at all and they have a moment of surprise! On the other hand, if they got a 10 or lower on that same check (failing it by 5), maybe as they're climbing the wall they take too long and the guards spot them!

This 'by 5's' system also connects to the core of DC20's Combat system. In Combat, when you roll 5 over the target's AC you deal more damage than you would normally, so this can also be true for Skill Checks.

**Example:** Here is a general outline for what each possible scenario might look like in a given situation. This example is for a DC of 20:

- 14 = Failure
- 15 = Partial Success with a setback (they got close but didn't hit the DC)
- 20 = Success
- 25 = Major Success (you get some additional benefit)

**DC Tip:** You can also do the same for Checks that succeed or fail by 10 or more! I try not to make this be too game altering or punishing, but it's nice to add some flavor to those extreme rolls.

## Complications

Going 'by 5's' is also simple when it comes to figuring out complications to a situation. Let's say there's a scenario where a PC is trying to walk across a simple rickety wooden bridge, the DC for this could be 10 (depending on how rickety it is). Now let's say it started to rain, or a strong breeze picked up, so you can just dial the DC up by one 'notch' to a DC 15! Simple! Then, if you want to add in that the PC is being chased by bandits and needs to hurry across as arrows and people chase them, now it's a DC 20!

It's very simple to step the DC up or down depending on extra things that happen around the situation at hand.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

For things that happen in the world, I adjust the DC up or down by 5, or even get it to a specific number as previously stated. However, when the PCs describe something they do, Game Masters can award Advantage (ADV) or Disadvantage (DisADV) to their roll based on their actions. If they're talking to a city guard and let it slip that they stole something, the GM can give them DisADV on their Check. If a PC comes up with a clever way to use an item or lever to lift something heavy, the GM could give them ADV on their Check.

**DC Tip:** Don't be afraid to award ADV and DisADV for players' interactions with the world. This lets them know if they're 'on the right track' with their thinking or not.

## Failing Forward

When someone fails a Check of some kind, it doesn't always mean they literally didn't do what they were trying to. If someone tries to break open a door and they fail the Might Check for it, that doesn't have to mean that the door didn't break. It could break but make such a loud noise that the guards are alerted, or maybe they're unlucky and there's a guard directly on the other side of the door. You could even have them smashing the door in this way lower the DC for the next person to attempt something.

It can feel really bad and take forever if you gate progress of the story behind needing to hit certain numbers. This can bring the game to a screeching halt, so instead, let them fail forward. Let each moment move the story forward in an interesting way.

## Game Master Guide

## Variable Attribute Skill Checks

Each Skill has a Base Attribute that is its 'home' on the Character Sheet. This is the default Attribute you would add to each Skill unless the GM calls for something else. In most scenarios, you will find yourself using the Skill's Base Attribute.

**Example:** When your GM tells you to make an Athletics Check, that'll most likely be based off your Might Attribute. When your GM tells you to make an Influence Check, that'll most likely be based off your Charisma Attribute.

This keeps the game moving quickly and avoids confusion on which Attribute you add to a given Check. If you're interested in a more customizable and creative approach to Skills, then here is how the 'Variable Attribute Rule' works.

## Variable Attribute Rule

Which Attribute you use for a given Skill Check depends on how you're using the Skill. This is a much more open approach to Skill Checks, and can be used to create any possible Check.

**DC Tip:** Players can get creative with alternative Attributes for Checks, but the GM always retains the authority to decide which Check the player will make.

Determining the default Check can be straightforward, but what if the PC wants to use a different Attribute or Skill with the Check or the GM wants to make the Check more precisely match the actions of the PC? This is where the Variable Attribute Rule comes in. There are 2 things to determine when making a Variable Skill Check:

**Determine The Skill:** Which skill is the PC trying to use in this moment? Based on what they're trying to accomplish, the Skill being used is usually pretty obvious.

**Determine The Attribute:** Which attribute are they using to accomplish this task? How are they using their Skill? Are they using Might, Agility, Intelligence, or Charisma to make this Check? There are many ways to approach the actions a PC might take during gameplay. See the examples below.

**DC Tip:** The GM should ideally choose a Variable Check that is well suited for the PC. If the Variable Check is worse off for the PC, they can always just choose to use the 'default' Skill Check instead.

### Variable Check Examples

Here are some examples of Variable Attributes being applied to scenarios for some great Skill Check results. I challenge you to think of how you could combine each of the 4 Attributes to each of the 13 General Skills. The format for describing these Checks is 'Skill (Attribute) Check' with the Skill being the first word and the Attribute being used inside of the parentheses.

**Animal (Might) Check:** A PC is wrestling a wild boar.

- Yes, this could be an Athletics (Might) Check, and maybe for most characters, that's what it would be. However, if you have a unique character that has a really high Animal Skill, it might make more sense for them to use that expertise with animals to their advantage.
- Alternatively, when you try to quickly grab an Animal you could make an Animal (Agility) Check.

**Trickery (Charisma) Check:** A PC is trying to impersonate the speech or accent of another NPC to trick someone into thinking they're someone else.

- Yes, this could be an Influence (Charisma) Check, because they're talking to another NPC to convince them of something, but if a character has put a lot of points into Trickery, it makes sense for this 'sly' character to be able to impersonate people better than most.
- If they were trying to devise a cunning plan to sneak into a location and infiltrate it, they could make a Trickery (Intelligence) Check instead.

**Medicine (Agility) Check:** A character is trying to carefully remove metal shards from an ally.

- Yes, I know Medicine's 'home' is Intelligence, and I would usually have Medicine Checks be used to see if you know something about things having to do with medicine. This, though, is a careful application of your medical knowledge needing the use of agile hand movements. I could even see someone using a Medicine (Might) Check to perform CPR or to jam a dislocated shoulder back into place.

**Intimidation (Intelligence) Check:** A character is trying to convince an NPC not to go into the dangerous forests, so they start listing off a bunch of scary facts about how terrifying a beast that lives in this forest is.

- Intimidation can easily be any of the 4 Base Attributes. Breaking something in half would be Might. Throwing a dagger right next to someone's head barely missing them would be Agility. Trying to manipulate a creature's actions using a social threat, extortion, or blackmail, could be an Intimidation (Charisma) Check. If your threat involves knowledge of key information or about the target specifically, you could make an Intimidation (Intelligence) Check.

**Insight (Intelligence) Check:** A PC is trying to figure something out based on past experiences. You can think of this as a PC's intuition.

# CHAPTER 4: Character Creation Rules

## 10 Step Character Creation Outline

During Player Character Creation you will get to customize your PC in the following ways at Level 1:

- Choose Starting Attributes
- Choose Background (Skills, Trades, and Languages)
- Choose an Ancestry and Class

## Player Character Creation

### Step 1: Attributes & Prime Modifier

You get your PC Attributes from one of the following methods and then assign the values to each of the 4 Attributes.

#### Standard Array

You start with an array of 3, 1, 0, -2 and assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain 2 additional Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

#### Point Buy

You start with a -2 in all of your Attributes. You then gain 12 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**DC Tip:** Your Prime Modifier (see later in this chapter) comes from your highest Attribute, so it's a good idea to make sure that you get a 3 in at least one of your Attributes.

#### Roll Method

You determine your starting values by rolling 1d6-3 four times, and then assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain +2 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**Prime Modifier Insurance:** If the value of your highest Attribute is less than 3 (even after adding the +2 Attribute Points), you can reduce a different Attribute value by 1 or more to increase your highest Attribute by the same amount. You can't reduce an Attribute value below -2 or increase an Attribute above your Attribute Limit (3).

**DC Tip:** This method of determining your starting Attributes is the most risky. It offers the potential for the highest starting Attributes, but also the lowest. If you add all your Attributes together, their sum should be 2 (on average). If you get less than this, then talk to your GM about potentially rerolling your Attributes (or using a different method).

#### Prime Modifier

Your Prime Modifier is equal to your PC's highest Attribute.

**DC Tip:** You really want a PC to have a 3 in one of their Attributes so they can have a 3 for their Prime Modifier at level 1. Your Prime Modifier is added to a lot of the things you do in Combat and is very important.

### Step 2: Save Masteries

You add your Attribute bonus and your Combat Mastery together. The result is your Save bonus for each Attribute.

### Step 3: Background (Skills, Trades, & Languages)

This represents how your were raised, what type of culture you were around, and what you have done since birth. You gain 'Traits' from your Background at 1st level that grant you some flavorful or mechanical benefits.

Each Background gives 5 Skill Points, 3 Trade Points, and 2 Language Points. You can't go over the Mastery Limit of Novice unless you have a Feature that allows you to do so.

**Beta Note:** The only piece 'missing' from Background is a 'Background Trait'. This will be something that's 100% FLAVOR based and only enhances roleplay.

#### Skills

Your Background gives you 5 Skill Points, but you also increase or decrease your Skill Points based on your Intelligence Attribute.

**Starting Skill Points = 5 + Intelligence** (yes, you do subtract if your Intelligence is negative).

#### Trades

Your Background gives you 3 Trade Points. You can convert 1 Skill Point into 2 Trade points, but not the other way around.

#### Languages

Your Background gives you Fluency in the Common Language and 2 Language Points that you can spend on any Language of your choice. Additionally, you can convert 1 Trade Point into 2 Language Points.

#### Background Starting Equipment

Coming Soon. You get a list of starting equipment based on your Background. You could instead choose to receive a flat amount of gold or even roll for your gold.

### Step 4: Health Points

Fill in your Character's HP. You may potentially add more if you choose an Ancestry or Class that grants bonus HP at Level 1.

**Starting HP Formula: Class HP + Might + Ancestry HP (if any)**

**Example:** A PC picks the Champion Class at Level 1 and starts with a Might of 3 (the highest possible at Level 1). The Champion Class grants a base of 9 HP. The PC then adds +3 HP from their Might to get a total of 12 HP (9 + 3). If any of their Ancestry Traits increase or decrease their HP, they would add those to the total to determine their starting HP.

### Step 5: Stamina & Mana Points

Fill in your Character's SP and MP. Martial Characters have 1 Stamina Point (SP), Spellcasters have 6 Mana Points (MP), and Hybrid Characters (such as a Spellblade) have 1 Stamina Point (SP) and 2 Mana Points (MP).

### Step 6: Defense

Fill in your Character's Precision and Area Defense.

#### Precision Defense

**PD = 8 + CM + Agility + Intelligence + Bonuses**

#### Area Defense

**AD = 8 + CM + Might + Charisma + Bonuses**

#### Damage Reduction

Fill in each section's Damage Reduction.

- **Physical Damage Reduction:** This only applies if you're wearing some types of Heavy Armor or Heavy Shields (or have some other feature that grants PDR).
- **Elemental Damage Reduction:** This only applies if you're wearing some types of Heavy Armor or Heavy Shields (or have some other feature that grants EDR).
- **Mystical Damage Reduction:** This most likely doesn't apply to your character (unless you have a feature that grants it).

### Step 7: Combat Modifiers

Fill out the rest of the blanks on your Character Sheet.

- **Attack Check:** +4
- **Save DC:** 14
- **Martial / Spell Check:** +4
- **Death Threshold:** -4
- **Move Speed:** 5
- **Jump Distance:** Equals your Agility (minimum of 1)
- **Rest Points:** Equal to your HP maximum
- **Grit Points:** 2 + Charisma

### Step 8: Ancestry

Choose an Ancestry. This represents your biology and how you've grown and developed since birth. You gain Ancestry Traits from your chosen Ancestry at 1st, 4th, and 7th level.

**DC Tip:** There are many different ways to create Ancestries (both visually and mechanically). Make sure to collaborate where needed with your GM.

#### Ancestry Traits

You choose 1 or 2 Ancestries to gain access to. You also get 5 Ancestry points that you can use to spend on Ancestry Traits (see 'Ancestry System' on page 104 for more).

**DC Tip:** Some of these Traits might affect things you've already added to your Character Sheet (such as HP, Speed, etc.).

### Step 10: Weapons & Inventory

Choose what starting equipment you want. You gain some from your Class and the rest from your Background.

**Beta Note:** Currently, this only includes Weapons and Armor. Starting Equipment will be added in a future update. I personally let my PCs choose from a list of general adventuring supplies and we go from there.

## Further Player Character Progression

Characters get stronger as they increases in Level. This chart shows what you get at each Level for all Classes.

**DC Tip:** This table is a general representation of what the 'standard' is for all classes, but make sure to check your Class specifically just in case.

### Player Character Progression Table

## Leveling Up

When a Character levels up these are the updates you need to make.

### Attribute Points

### Skill, Trade, & Language Points

Check your Player Character Progression Table and see if you gain any Skill Points or Trade Points.

### Health

These are the categories that you could gain HP in:

- Check your Class Table for additional HP.
- If you increase your Might Attribute, then you also increase your HP by 1 for each point of Might you gain.

### Multiclass Talents

Multiclass Talents allow you to gain Features from other Classes, except Flavor Features (see Class Flavor Features below). Some Multiclass Talents also allow you to gain Subclass Features, which can be from any Class (including your own). You can't gain the same Feature more than once.

**Class Flavor Features:** Once you gain 2 Class Features from the same Class, you automatically gain that Class's Flavor Feature.

**Example:** If a Wizard gains 2 Barbarian Features, they automatically gain the Barbarian's Flavor Feature: Shattering Force.

**Specific Damage Types:** When you gain a Feature that references a damage type of a different Feature, you use that same damage type. If there are multiple choices of damage types to choose from, you must choose one when you gain the Feature.

**Example:** The Cleric Feature: Channel Divinity has an option (Censure Divine) that deals 'Divine Damage' to nearby creatures of your choice. The Cleric normally choose their type of Divine Damage at level 1 when they gain the Cleric Order Feature. If a Champion uses a Multiclassing Talent to gain the Channel Divinity Feature, they would need to choose a type of Divine Damage listed in the Cleric Order Feature.

# CHAPTER 5: Ancestries

## Ancestry System

During character creation you must choose your character's **Ancestry**, which represents the physical form your character takes in the world, such as Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling and Gnome. Each Ancestry has a list of **Ancestry Traits**, which you can gain by spending **Ancestry Points**.

## Ancestry Traits

Ancestry Traits give your character physiological properties or abilities based on your Ancestry. You can choose various combinations of Ancestry Traits to customize your character to express the type of fantasy race you want to play.

## Ancestry Points

Ancestry Points can be spent to gain Ancestry Traits. Most Traits cost between 1 and 3 Points, however, some Traits have a Point value of 0 or lower: **Minor Traits** and **Negative Traits**.

## Gaining Ancestry Points

When first creating your character, you have 5 Ancestry Points. You gain 2 additional Ancestry Points when you reach Level 4, and again when you reach Level 7.

## Types of Ancestry Traits

Each Ancestry has 4 kinds of Ancestry Traits.

### Minor Ancestry Traits

These Traits cost 0 Ancestry Points and provide minor benefits that are respective of each Ancestry's unique abilities and origins. You can only choose 1 Minor Trait.

### Negative Ancestry Traits

These are Traits that have a negative Point value due to a penalty it gives your Character. These give you additional Ancestry Points equal to the negative value of the Trait.

**Example:** If you choose the Negative Trait Reckless (-1), then you would gain the Trait (which reduces your PD by 1) and also gain 1 Ancestry Point (since the value of the Trait is worth -1). After this, you would technically have 6 total Ancestry Points to spend, but you would still end with a total of 5 (6 - 1).

### Default Ancestry Traits

These are a set of pre-defined Ancestry Traits that are worth a total 5 Ancestry Points. These include a Minor Trait and may also include a Negative Trait.

**DC Tip:** This is perfect for new players! They can just say, 'I want to be an Elf,' and get the pre-made list of the Elf Default Traits and be done with this step of Character Creation.

### Expanded Ancestry Traits

These are optional Ancestry Traits that you can choose from to customize your Character's Ancestry for either mechanical or flavor reasons.

**DC Tip:** Some groups or GMs might choose to ignore these Expanded Ancestry Traits to speed up character creation (for new groups or for one shots) or to give a consistent feel to all Ancestries.

## Ancestry Origins

### Ancestry Flavor vs Mechanics

Player Characters are unique in this aspect, and with so many options you're able to create a wide variety of Ancestry Origins. You can customize them and make them your own, either for mechanical reasons or flavor/lore reasons.

### Ancestry Flavor

This is where you can say what your Character looks like based on their Ancestry. Maybe you choose Dwarf and Elf for your 2 Ancestries. Now you get to decide how they look, which has nothing to do with game mechanics. Maybe you're a tall slender elf with a huge beard, maybe you're a thick stocky dwarf with smooth hairless skin and pointy ears, or maybe you look completely like a Dwarf and all of those 'Elven Traits' are more recessive and aren't represented visually. You might have the EYES of an elf, but everything else looks Dwarvish.

**DC Tip:** Maybe you love the Mechanics of a Gnome, but you really want to play a Halfling. Talk to your GM about if it's ok to completely separate the mechanics of your character from what you visually look like. Work together and brainstorm how your Halfling Character gained the mechanics of a Gnome (through magic, through practice, or etc.).

If you wanted to play a Dwarf that had a backstory of being from a long line of Dwarves, you totally can! Pick Dwarf and then ask yourself, 'How else do I want to express my Character?' If you're going to be a Cleric, then maybe look into the Angelborn Traits. If you want to play a brave Dwarf, then maybe look into the Halfling (they have a Halfling Bravery Trait). This doesn't mean that you are that Ancestry, or that one of your parents were, it's just a way to further express your character and let them have the Traits that best fit them.

**DC Tip:** If your ideal Dwarf possess Traits only included in the Giantborn Ancestry list, pick some of those Traits for your 'Dwarf' so you can create the character you have in mind. You can describe your Mixed Ancestry character as being a specific kind of Dwarf or a Dwarf/Giantborn hybrid. You can express your Ancestry however you wish.

### Ancestry Mechanics

This is where you choose your Ancestries based on the game mechanics of what Ancestry Traits they offer. Build out your character accordingly and then step back and see what your character would look like. I had a player make a character that just wanted to make a BIG Barbarian, so he chose Giantborn and Orc. I asked him what that looks like, and we talked about it and decided that he was going to be an 'Ogre-born' which ended up being a really cool enhancement to his backstory... even though his choices were based on game mechanics.

### Ancestry Appearance

The appearance of this new Ancestry is for the PC and GM to come up with together (also making sure it fits into the lore of the setting). The Ancestry could look similar to an already existing Ancestry but be magically different for other reasons. The Ancestry could be an entirely new species that you want to bring into the world, mixing and matching Traits around to get the exact right feel for your PC.

**DC Tip:** How I have always handled this is that the visual aspect of a character is completely up to the player, then the Ancestry Points take care of the 'balance' and the mechanics of what that Ancestry can do.

### Ancestry Lore & Flavor

Each Ancestry has unique biological and cultural pieces that can combine with Backgrounds to create very unique PCs.

- Unique Biology Facts
- Ancestry Quirks Table
- Names List
- Ancestries' Cultures

This will be available at the release of the full game. The Beta is focused on the mechanics of the game, so the flavor and lore will be revealed in the future.

## Ancestry Creation

Every character starts with the Base Ancestry Traits below, and their Ancestry gives them a list of additional Traits they can spend their 5 Ancestry Points on.

### Base Ancestry Traits

- **Size:** Your Size is Medium.
- **Speed:** You have a Speed of 5 Spaces.
- **Creature Type:** Your Creature Type is Humanoid.

## Choose Your Ancestry

Pick 1 or 2 Ancestries to show where your character comes from, what they look like, or how they perform mechanically. This usually represents what Ancestry your character's parents were. When you select an Ancestry, you gain access to its Ancestry Traits List (Default and Expanded).

### Starting With 1 Ancestry

You gain access to its Ancestry List. You can choose a second Ancestry any time you gain additional Ancestry Points.

**DC Tip:** This does give you less options during Character Creation, but gives you more flexibility to choose a second Ancestry at a later time as the direction you take your character evolves.

### Starting With 2 Ancestries

You gain access to both Ancestry Lists of each chosen Ancestry.

**DC Tip:** This gives you more options during character creation, but somewhat less flexibility at higher levels when you gain additional Ancestry Points.

## Spend Your Ancestry Points

You have 5 Ancestry Points to spend on any Ancestry Traits from among your Ancestry Trait Lists. Your Ancestry needs to have a total of 5 Ancestry Points worth of Traits (including negative Traits). You can choose multiple Negative Traits, but you can only choose 1 Minor Trait. You must spend all your Ancestry points during character creation (you can't save them for later).

### Gaining & Losing Negative Traits

You can't gain more than 2 Ancestry Points total from your Negative Ancestry Traits. You can remove Negative Ancestry Traits at higher Levels by spending 1 Ancestry Point if their cost is (-1) or 2 Ancestry Points if their cost is (-2).

### Duplicate Ancestry Traits

You can't choose a Trait of the same name multiple times, unless it says otherwise.

**Example:** A PC chooses Dwarf and Giantborn as their 2 Ancestries. The Tough Ancestry Trait is available to both Ancestries. The PC could only choose the Tough Ancestry Trait once, even though it's available to both Ancestries.

### Ancestry Trait Requirements

If an Ancestry Trait has a requirement, such as a Level requirement, then you must meet that requirement to choose that Ancestry Trait.

### Attribute & Mastery Increases

Certain Ancestry Traits grant increases to Attributes, Skills, and Trades. These Ancestry Traits can't exceed the Attribute Limit, Skill Mastery Limit, or Trade Mastery Limit, unless they say otherwise.

### Refunding Ancestry Traits

If you gain a Talent or Feature that grants you a benefit that's identical to (or a better version of) an Ancestry Trait you have, you can choose to immediately replace that Ancestry Trait with 1 or more other Ancestry Traits available to you that are worth the same amount of Ancestry Points.

**Example 1:** A Dwarf with the Natural Combatant Ancestry Trait (grants Mastery with Heavy Armor and all Shields) uses their 2nd Level Talent to pick the Martial Expansion Talent (grants Mastery with all Weapons, Armors, and Shields), then the Dwarf would be refunded the Ancestry Points they spent to gain Natural Combatant and would need to immediately use those Points to gain a different Ancestry Trait available to them.

**Example 2:** If you have an Ancestry Trait that grants you Water Breathing and Swim Speed, then later you gain a Class Feature that ONLY grants a Swim Speed (but not Water Breathing), that would NOT count and you wouldn't get any Ancestry Points refunded to you (you would keep both). If you later get another feature that ONLY grants Water Breathing, you could then get a refund for the Ancestry Trait since you would have other Features or Talents granting you the exact same (or better) abilities.

**DC Tip:** There might be a scenario where a Minor Trait is replaced by a Feature or Talent. In this case a GM could allow a Player to pick another Minor Trait from another Ancestry (if it would make sense for that PC).

## Variant Rules

### Custom Ancestries

If you want to give your PC a personalized Ancestry or you want to combine 3 or more Ancestries together, you can create a Custom Ancestry. This gives Characters access to ALL Ancestry Lists at once but only gets 4 points to spend instead of 5. All other Ancestry Creation Rules still apply. When you gain Ancestry Points, you can spend them on any Ancestry List of your choice.

**DC Tip:** You could also choose to let PCs get the full 5 Ancestry Points for their Custom Ancestry, but keep in mind that this would be VERY strong and the default option for most everyone at the table (for both min-maxing and roleplay reasons). If you're ok with this, then let them have the full 5 Points instead of 4.

### Variable Negativity

This Variant Rule allows you to gain Negative Ancestry Traits when you gain Ancestry Points after Character Creation. You still can't gain more than 2 Ancestry Points total from your Negative Ancestry Traits at a time.

### Stronger or Weaker Ancestries

Game Masters can choose to start the game off with higher or lower Ancestry Point totals (instead of 5).

**Lower Points:** If you want less power to come from Ancestries, and want it to be more of a subtle thing they get, you can lower the Ancestry Point total down to 4, 3, or 2. The player would have to choose which Ancestry Traits they get to use to equal that total for that character.

**Higher Points:** If you want to give your players more power and customization at the start of the game, you can give them more Ancestry Points to build a stronger Ancestry with.

**DC Tip:** I would be very careful with this. The game is balanced around PCs getting 5 points, so there could be some very powerful combinations players could take advantage of.

### Ancestry Adoption

This option allows you to select one Ancestry Trait from any Ancestry available, then follow the rules as written for spending the rest of your Ancestry Points.

**DC Tip:** You could be making this choice for tactical combat reasons, roleplay reasons, or anything in between. Talk to your GM (and even the rest of your party) to show what unique twist you've added to your PC.

### Ancestry 'Magic Items'

This option allows you to 'think outside the box' on why your PC can do what they can do and where they got their 'powers' from. With this rule, you can choose from any of the Ancestry Traits and give yourself a 'magic item' that represents that power. You can do this multiple times for multiple points worth of traits. You can tie all these points into a single item or into multiple items.

**Example:** You want to play a 'normal' Human PC, but you REALLY want to have a Breath Weapon (from the Dragonborn Ancestry) and don't want to say that you're part Dragonborn. You can create a Human with 3 points spent in the Human Ancestry, then with the other 2 points you can get the Dragonborn's Breath Weapon but describe that it comes from a 'magic ring' on your finger. This allows you to play the fantasy of a human while still having the magical abilities that you want.

**DC Tip:** I've done this myself with Class Features before. I had a PC who was a complete commoner, but he happened to find a magic sword. As soon as he picked it up he was granted the powers of a Spellblade. If I ever lost the sword, then those powers were gone. It's a very unique way to make a unique PC.

### GM and PC Notes

Keep in mind that this 'feature' is now being represented by an object that's not part of the PC. This means that it could be stolen or possibly work differently if the PCs go to an area that nullifies the effects of magic items (making the item stop working). So have an open dialogue with each other about this and how it might look at your table.

- **(0) Fallen:** You can now spend your Ancestry Points on Fiendborn Traits.

  - **Altitude Drop:** If you end your turn midair, you Controlled Fall 4 Spaces.
  - **Glide Speed:** You can use your movement to glide horizontally.
- **(-1) Pacifist:** Your divine call is to put others before yourself and resist doing harm. You suffer a -1 penalty to all Checks and Saves made during the first round of Combat.

## Fiendborn

### Fiendish Origin

Choose a Fiendish Origin from the following list: Cold, Corrosion, Fire, Poison, and Umbral. All future choices within this Ancestry must use the chosen Fiendish Origin. The type of damage associated with your Fiendish Origin is your Fiendish damage.

### Fiendborn Redemption

If you choose to play a Fiendborn and go down a path of redemption, you can choose to be a Redeemed Fiendborn. This can happen at character creation from good acts done from your backstory, or this can happen mid-campaign after a large change in your character.

You gain the following Ancestry Trait:

- **(0) Redeemed:** You can now spend your Ancestry Points on Angelborn Traits.

**DC Tip:** You aren't considered to be an Angelborn, you just gain access to its Traits. You can only have one '0 Point' Ancestry Trait when creating your character, so if you want to start the game with this feature you can't take Light's Bane.

### Default Traits

- **(2) Fiendish Resistance:** You gain Resistance (Half) to your Fiendish damage type.
- **(2) Fiendish Magic:** You learn 1 Spell of your choice from the Arcane Spell List from the Destruction or Enchantment Spell Schools. If the Spell deals damage, it must be the same damage type as your Fiendish damage. Once per Long Rest, you can cast the chosen Spell spending 1 less MP than normal (minimum of 0 MP). The Spell's total MP cost (before all reductions) still can't exceed your Mana Spend Limit.
- **(1) Darkvision:** You have a Darkvision of 10 Spaces.

# CHAPTER 6: Classes

## DC20 Class List

In DC20, all characters belong to one of several **Classes**, each defining their role, strengths, and progression in combat and adventure. Classes fall into two primary categories: **Martial** and **Spellcaster**.

**Martial Classes** rely on physical prowess, tactical skill, and Stamina to overcome their foes—these include the **Barbarian**, **Champion**, **Commander**, **Monk**, **Hunter**, and **Rogue**.

Standing at the crossroads of both worlds, the **Spellblade** blends martial discipline with spellcasting, making it both a Martial and a Spellcaster Class.

### Martial Classes

## Barbarian

Barbarians charge into battle with reckless abandon, ignoring their own safety as they brush off damage and deal even more in return. They trade defense for more offense and let out blood-crazed battle cries.

**Source of Power:** Barbarians become overtaken by a surge of strength called Rage. This can manifest as rage, possession, primal power, or something else entirely. A protective Barbarian could tap into their power if their friends are in danger. A frightened Barbarian could lash out when they're scared. There are many possibilities for where a Barbarian's power of Rage comes from.

**DC Tip:** Or of course an ANGRY Barbarian might want to smash everything in sight!

  - **Auditory:** Through singing, playing music, poetry, comedy, or storytelling, you can ignore the Somatic Components of a Spell you cast, but you must provide a Verbal Component instead.

**Crowd Pleaser (Flavor Feature)**
When you spend at least 5 minutes performing an Artistry Trade for one or more people who are actively watching or listening to your performance, you can make an Artistry Trade Check Contested by the targets' Charisma Save. **Success:** You gain ADV on Charisma Checks against the target for 1 hour or until you become hostile. Creatures have ADV on the Save if they're considered hostile toward you.

**DC Tip:** If the performance is in front of a lot of people, the GM might decide to roll for ALL 'commoners' in one single Save. For example, a group of commoners' Charisma Save would probably only be a +1 or so. If there were also important NPCs within the crowd, then they could roll for those individually.

If your Spell targets more than 1 creature, the blessing only applies to 1 target of your choice.

**Divine Omen (Flavor Feature)**
Once per Long Rest, you can spend 10 minutes to commune with your Deity.

- **Question:** You can ask them 1 question, which must be posed in a way that could be answered with a yes or no.
- **Response:** The deity responds to the best of their knowledge and intentions in one of the following responses: Yes, No, or Unclear.
  - A response of Unclear could come from the deity not knowing the answer, wanting to purposefully keep it a secret, the question being phrased in a confusing or complicated way, or there not being a simple answer to the question.
  - **Example:** The response could be audible (a formless voice), visual (words that appear in the sky or on a book), symbolic (images and shapes telling a story). The answer could be delivered by a creature (random animal or human becomes possessed and starts talking), in your surroundings (talking flames, whispering wind, moving objects), within your own mind (a dream or vision), or by any other means they want.
  - **DC Tip:** Regardless of how the answer is given, it should be clear to the PLAYER what the answer was.

## Druid

Druids tap into the power of nature, drawing upon the energies that flow through the world and creatures around them. and connect to plants, animals, and the plane itself. They can channel both the restorative and destructive forces of nature and shapeshift into wild beasts.

**Source of Power:** A Druid's connection to nature can come from a deep respect, love, and appreciation of the natural world. Some Druids are blessed by a god or spirit of nature, granting them innate magical abilities. Others immerse themselves in nature by living in the wild, communing with the land and creatures to gain power and insight. They can sense and connect to nature and use its magic as their own.

#### Level 1 Class Features

**Druid Domain**
You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to create your own Druid Domain that includes small plant life, sand, shallow water, or other naturally occurring features. You create up to 8 Domain Spaces along the ground or walls. The first Domain Space must be within 1 Space of you, and each additional Domain Space must be adjacent to another Domain Space. If you use this Feature again, the first Domain Space of it must be within 1 Space of you or another Domain Space.

- **Domain Spaces:** The area is considered to be Difficult Terrain for creatures of your choice, and when you cast a Spell, you can do so as if you were standing in any Space within your Domain.
- **Losing Domain Spaces:** A Domain Space also disappears if you end your turn farther than 15 Spaces away from it or you die.

**Domain Actions:**
While you have Domain Spaces, you can take any of the following Domain Actions:

- **Nature's Grasp:** You can spend 1 AP to attempt to bind a creature of your choice within your Domain. Make a Spell Check against the target's Repeated Physical Save. **Success:** The target is **Immobilized** by your Domain for 1 minute or until the Domain Space it occupies ends.
- **Move Creature:** You can spend 1 AP to move a creature bound by this feature up to 2 Spaces within your Domain.
- **Move Object:** You can take the **Object** Action to use your vines to interact with any object within your Domain as if you were standing in any of your Domain Spaces. When you do, you can move the object up to 5 Spaces within your Domain.
- **Wild Growth:** You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to make a DC 10 Spell Check to heal a target within your Domain. **Success:** The target immediately regains 1 HP. For the next minute, they regain an additional 1 HP each time they end their turn within your Domain. **Success (each 5):** They immediately regain +1 HP. **Failure:** The target only regains 1 HP immediately.

**Wild Form**
You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to transform into a Wild Form of your choice. You can spend 1 AP on your turn to shift back and forth between your True Form and any Wild Forms you currently have available. Once per Long Rest, you can transform without spending MP or using MP enhancements.

- **True Form:** When you transform from your Wild Form to your True Form, your statistics return to normal. You immediately revert to your True Form when your Wild Form HP is reduced to 0 or you die.
- **Wild Form:** When you transform into a Wild Form, you gain the Wild Form's current Wild Form HP (see Wild Form HP below), retaining any HP losses.
  - **Duration:** Each Wild Form remains available until its Wild Form HP is reduced to 0 or you complete a Long Rest.
  - **Multiple Forms:** You can have multiple Wild Forms available at a time which have their own Wild Form HP and Traits.
  - **Equipment:** Your equipment falls to the ground or merges into your Wild Form (your choice for each item). You gain the benefits of Magic Items merged with your Wild Form, but you can't activate them or spend their charges.

**Statistics:**
While in your Wild Form, you're subjected to the following changes (unless otherwise stated):

- **Stat Block:** You use the Wild Form Stat Block below to determine your statistics.
- **Identity:** You maintain your personality, intellect, and ability to speak.
- **Wild Form HP:** You gain a secondary pool of Wild Form Health Points, which is 3 with a maximum of 3. Damage and healing effects target your Wild Form HP before your True Form HP, and any excess damage or healing carries over to your own HP.
- **Natural Weapon:** You have Natural Weapons (claws, horns, fangs, etc.) which you can use to make Unarmed Strikes that deal 1 Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage (your choice when you use this Feature).
- **Features & Talents:** You don't benefit from Talents or Class Features, except Druid Class Features, Subclass Features, and Talents. Additionally, you can't cast Spells or perform Maneuvers.
- **Traits:** You don't benefit from your Ancestry Traits, but you gain 3 Trait Points to spend on Beast Traits or Wild Form Traits of your choice. You can't select negative Beast Traits. When you use this Feature, you can spend additional MP (up to your Mana Spend Limit) to gain 2 additional Trait Points per MP spent.
  - **DC Tip:** Most animals can be modeled by giving them the Keen Senses and Skillful Traits.

#### Wild Form Stat Block

Small or Medium Beast (your choice)
| HP | 3 | AP | Same |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PD | 8+CM+PM | PDR | 0 |
| AD | 8+CM+PM | MDR | 0 |
| Speed | 5 | Masteries | Same |
| Prime | Same | Save DC | Same |
| MIG | 1 | CHA | Same |
| AGI | 1 | INT | Same |

**DC Tip:** Shapeshifting presents a unique problem for players, since they can have Mastery in something that's physically difficult or even impossible for them. Fish don't pick locks and slugs can't intimidate, but maybe a monkey can. Consider changing DCs for Checks in some animal forms.

**Wild Speech (Flavor)**
You learn the Druidcraft Cantrip and can choose 1 of the following options:

- **Animals:** You can understand and speak with Beasts in a limited manner. You can understand the meaning of their movements, sounds, and behaviors, and they can understand the meanings of simple words, concepts, and emotions.
- **Plants:** You can understand and speak with Plants in a limited manner. You can understand the meaning of their swaying, folding, unfolding of their leaves and flowers, and they can understand the meanings of simple words, concepts, and emotions.
- **Weather:** You can reach out to nature and cast the Commune with Nature Spell as a Ritual once per Long Rest.

#### Wild Speech Sidebar

One thing to keep in mind with communicating with plants and animals is that they have a very different worldview than people.

**Communicating with Animals**

- **The World:** An animal might know a lot about the region it lives in, such as local sources of food and water, the presence of other animals, and the location of roads and shelters of nearby savage and civilized societies.
- **Other Inhabitants:** An animal might only recognize the existence of creatures as prey (deer, sheep, and rabbits) and predators (bears, tigers, and wolves).
- **Quirks:** If asked a question, an animal would respond with words rather than sentences, such as 'cold', 'hungry', 'scared', and 'safe'. They are instinctual creatures that operate on emotion.

**Communicating with Plants**

- **The World:** A plant might not be able to conceive the possibility of other locations, and may describe creatures as having appeared then disappeared with no notion of where they came from or went to.
- **Other Inhabitants:** A plant might only recognize the existence of creatures as friends (bees, birds, and frogs) and enemies (rabbits, deer, and lumberjacks).
- **Passing of Time:** A seedling might consider a recent event something that happened a moment ago and an ancient event something that happened yesterday. An ancient oak tree might consider a recent event something that happened 10 years ago, and an ancient event something over 100 years.
- **Expertise:** A plant may be able to describe in keen detail the different kinds of rains, storms, quality of soil, and various local bugs and herbivores.

The torrent fills a 3 Space Diameter Sphere centered on the target that lasts for 1 minute. While creatures are within the area, they have Vulnerability (1) against the triggering damage type and have DisADV on Checks and Saves to resist being moved or knocked **Prone**.

When the Trap is triggered, it makes an Attack Check to deal Prime Piercing damage and 2 Fire damage as well as forcing a Save against the **Burning** Condition.

**Discerning Eye (Flavor Feature)**
You have ADV on Awareness Checks to discover Hidden Traps and on Investigation Checks to discern how to disarm them.

### Starting Equipment

- **Arsenal:** Choose 3 of any of the following items: Weapon or Light Shield.
- **Armor:** 1 set of Light Armor.
- **Trade Tools:** Choose 1 of any of the following items: Cryptographer's Tools, Disguise Kit, Herbalist's Supplies, or Lockpicking Tools.
- **Adventuring Pack:** Choose 1 of the following packs: (Adventuring Packs Coming Soon).

### Rogue Martial Path

- **Combat Training:** Weapons, Light Armor, Light Shields
- **Maneuvers:** The number of Maneuvers you know increases as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Rogue Class Table.
- **Stamina Points:** Your maximum number of Stamina Points increases as shown in the Stamina Points column of the Rogue Class Table.
- **Stamina Regen:** Once per Round, you can regain up to half your maximum SP when:
  - You Hit a Flanked or **Prone** target.
  - You Hit a target affected by at least 1 Condition.
  - You Hit a target you're Hidden from.
  - You gain the benefits of your **Cunning Action**.

### Rogue Class Features

#### Level 1 Class Features

**Debilitating Strike**
When you make a Weapon Attack, you can spend 1 SP to force the target to make a Physical Save against your Save DC. **Save Failure:** The target suffers 1 of the following effects of your choice for 1 Round: **Deafened**, **Exposed**, **Hindered**, or **Slowed 2**. A target can't be affected by the same option more than once at a time.

**Roguish Finesse**

- **Cunning Action:** You gain movement equal to half your Speed when you take the **Disengage**, **Feint**, or **Hide** Actions. You can use this movement immediately before or after you take the Action.
- **Skill Expertise:** Your Skill Mastery Limit increases by 1, up to Grandmaster (+10). A Skill can only benefit from one increase to its Mastery limit.
- Multi-Skilled: You gain 1 Skill Point.

**Cypher Speech (Flavor Feature)**
You become Fluent in a Mortal Language of your choice. Additionally, you understand how to speak in code with a specific demographic of your choice (such as upper society, lower society, a faction, etc.). Your coded messages can be concealed in normal conversation and written communications. This allows you to leave simple messages such as 'Safety', 'Threat', or 'Wealth', or mark the location of a cache, a secret passageway, a safehouse, or an area of danger.

**DC Tip:** This could be anything from the slang of the slums, to the fancy language of the upper classes. It could even be more specific as some kind of bizarre double speak between twin siblings or between the political elite. If the Player doesn't know what to choose for this, they can always defer to a generic thieves guild option.

#### Level 2 Class Features

**Cheap Shot**
You deal +1 damage on Martial Attacks against a creature that fulfills at least one of the following:

- It's **Flanked** or **Prone**.
- It has any Condition other than **Invisible**.
- You're Hidden from it.

**Talent**
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.

### Subclasses

#### Long Death

**Thousand Cuts**
When a creature fails its Save against your **Debilitating Strike**, it also begins **Bleeding** (even if it's immune to the Condition). If a creature is affected by **Bleeding** from this Feature, the DC to end any **Bleeding** on it is equal to your Save DC and it can no longer be ended by regaining HP.

**DC Tip:** These Rogues are able to apply magic or alchemical toxins to their blades that eat away at their targets over time, even things like Elementals or Undead that don't have blood. The specific narrative reasoning is up to you.

**Hundred Ways to Die (Flavor Feature)**
You are an expert at studying and identifying weaknesses in bodies and how best to kill creatures. You have ADV on any Check made to determine how something died or could die easier. This also extends to poisons, toxins, or identifying other materials used to kill.

#### Swashbuckler

**Renegade Duelist**
You're skilled at making a mockery of your opponents while taking advantage of their openings. You gain the following benefits:

- **Flourishes:** Your **Cunning Action** now also includes the **Disarm** and **Dodge** Actions.
- **Taunting Shot:** Once per round, when you make an Attack against a creature that fulfills the criteria for **Cheap Shot**, you can forgo your **Cheap Shot** damage to force the target to make a Charisma Save instead. **Save Failure:** The target is **Taunted** by you until the end of your next turn.
- **Riposte:** When a creature within your Melee Range misses you with a Melee Attack, it provokes an Opportunity Attack from you.

**Tall Tales (Flavor Feature)**
You know how to play to a crowd. You can spend up to 5 minutes telling a story to a crowd of creatures (that are not immediately hostile to you) and keep their rapt attention the entire time. During this story, creatures within the crowd have DisADV on Awareness Checks.

**DC Tip:** A creature with DisADV on Awareness would have a -5 penalty to their Passive Awareness.

## Sorcerer

Sorcerers tap into the raw magic in their own bodies as a conduit to harness, manipulate, and sculpt magic with wild resolve. They can overload themselves and even cast Spells without Mana, pushing the limits of magic and their own bodies.

**Source of Power:** A Sorcerer's magic is in their blood, allowing them to tap into it naturally and use it in ways others can't. This could come from a lineage of angels, dragons, demons, or something else. Some Sorcerers' power could come from an incident that caused their body to be suffused with magic (such as a magical explosion, a blessing, or curse).

## Spellblade

Spellblades combine their combat prowess with their ability to harness and channel magic into weapons. They can form a bond with a weapon to imbue it with damage, call it back to them, and more. Spellblades can learn a wide range of disciplines depending on their unique combination of martial and spellcasting prowess. They even gain the ability to cast spells through their weapons.

**Source of Power:** Spellblades are unique in that there are a variety of ways and sources for them to harness their power. They could draw this magic from a wide variety of sources. Here are just a few examples:

- Power bestowed by a patron, deity, or some powerful entity that takes an interest in them.
- An external or supernatural force that even they don't fully understand.
- Their own bloodline or connections to the past.
- Their careful study and practice of both swords and spells.
- They take up their blade in honor of a deity, cause, or goal.
- They make an oath or vow to someone (or themselves) to stand for or against something.
- An expression of emotion through artistic flourishes with their weapon.
- A strange weapon they pulled from a stone granted them the powers of a Spellblade.

- **Spell Warder:** When you deal Elemental or Mystical damage with an Attack, you gain Resistance (1) to that damage for 1 Round. If you deal Elemental or Mystical damage again while this is already active, you can choose to keep the current Resistance or switch it out for the new one instead.
- **Blink Blade:** Once per turn, when you make an Attack, you can choose to teleport to a Space you can see within 1 Space immediately before or after making the Attack (your choice).

**Sense Magic (Flavor Feature)**
You can spend 1 minute focusing your mind to detect the following creature types within 20 Spaces: Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead. Make a Spell Check against each creature's Mental Save. **Check Success:** You learn the target's creature type and know its location until the end of your next turn. **Check Failure:** You learn nothing and can't use this Feature against the target again until you complete a Long Rest.

#### Level 2 Class Features

**Spellstrike**
Once on each of your turns when you make a Martial Attack, you can also cast a Spell as part of the same Action, spending 1 AP less than normal.

- **Converged Action:** When you do, the Spell can only target 1 creature who must be a target of the Attack, and the range of the Attack can't exceed the range of the Spell. If the Spell requires a Check, it uses your Attack Check instead. Any Saves the Spell forces the target to make are made against your Save DC.
- **Harmonic Strike:** The Martial Attack and Spell from a Spellstrike are treated as 1 Attack, and can benefit from Martial Enhancements and Spell Enhancements. The Spell doesn't require Somatic Components.
  - **DC Tip:** Because it's treated as 1 Attack, the damage from the Martial Attack and Spell benefit from Critical Hits, Heavy Hits, and beyond only once.

**Example 1:** A Spellblade makes a Weapon Attack using a Shortsword (1 Slashing damage) as part of the Attack Action. They choose to use Spellstrike, which lets them also cast a Spell as part of the same Action. They choose the Firebolt Spell (1 Fire damage). Normally the Spell costs 1 AP to cast, but now costs 0 AP (since Spellstrike reduces its cost by 1). On a Hit, the Spellstrike deals 2 total damage (1 Slashing and 1 Fire).

**Extended Example 1:** The same Spellblade from Example 1 can add even more to their Spellstrike, by spending AP to add Martial Enhancements or to add the Firebolt Spell's Spell Enhancement options that cost AP. You can also spend SP to use **Smite**.

**Talent**
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.

You make an oath to uphold the tenets of your choice below (or create your own with GM approval). While you're following your oath, you have ADV on Checks made to convince non-hostile creatures to join you in doing so.

**Tenets:**

## Warlock

Warlocks make a pact with a powerful entity that grants them magic. Their body and soul are a part of this contract and as such, they can tap into their own life force to enhance and amplify their magic and capabilities as well as drain the life force of other living creatures. They also choose a type of pact to be made that grants more powers.

**Source of Power:** Warlocks gain their power through a pact with a powerful entity. By making a deal with this entity (and following the conditions), they gain access to magic that they can channel as their own. Unlike a Cleric (who believes in, follows, and has a true relationship with their deity), Warlocks simply make a deal and have more of a transactional or business relationship with their patron. Pacts can be made with all sorts of entities of all ranges of power levels as well, such as gods, devils, fey creatures, otherworldly beings, dragons, and even other powerful Warlocks.

**Warlock Flavor:** A Warlock pact could be made by choice or by force, could be demanding or simple, and could be made with a good, neutral, or evil entity (which might be unknown by the Warlock). The Character might have to accomplish certain tasks in order to keep their powers, or the entity might take a more passive role and not ask much from them.

  - **Weapon Training:** You're considered to have Combat Training with your Pact Weapon.

If they choose to respond, they enter your mind and you might possibly be able to see or hear them. While connected to your Patron in this way, you're aware of your surroundings but you can't take actions or move. Your Patron chooses when to end the connection, or you can make a Mental Save against your own Save DC to force the connection to end.

Your Inner Sanctum can look different depending on your Patron. It could be in a foggy blackness, wreathed in flames, or emitting a blinding light. Your Patron has full control over your dream state and can shape the environment, create landscapes, objects, creatures, and images.

**DC Tip:** This is a narrative driven feature where the GM can roleplay the Warlock's Patron to grant information or even mechanical boons to the character.

## Wizard

Wizards learn to master each of the Spell Schools to control them in a structured and efficient way. They utilize sigils on the ground to enhance certain types of magic while they push spells to their limits.

**Source of Power:** Wizards learn to use magic from a dedicated study of the arcane through practicing lessons and reading tomes. This knowledge could come from a wizard school they attend, a family tome that has been passed down through the generations, or even from a spell book they stole and just kept practicing with.

**Arcane Sigil**
You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to choose a Spell School or Spell Tag and create a 1 Space diameter Circle on a surface within a Space you're occupying. The Circle is your Arcane Sigil which lasts for 1 minute. You can't place more than 1 Arcane Sigil in the same Space.

- **Using a Sigil:** While within the area of your Arcane Sigil, creatures gain ADV on Checks they make to cast or produce the effects of Spells with the chosen Spell School or Spell Tag.
- **Moving a Sigil:** You can spend 1 AP to teleport one of your Arcane Sigils that's within 10 Spaces to a surface within a Space you're occupying, provided the Space doesn't already have an Arcane Sigil.

**DC Tip:** A magical sigil like this radiates the magic of the chosen School making its type of magic discernable by effects that can detect magic.

**Example:** A Wizard can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to create an Arcane Sigil on the ground, ceiling, or a wall that's within the Space they're occupying. If they choose the Fire Spell Tag, anyone within the Arcane Sigil would have ADV on Checks made to cast Spells with the Fire Spell Tag.

- **Linked Magic:** While within 1 Space of a connected Arcane Sigil, you can make an Attack or cast a Spell as if you were standing in the Space of the other connected Arcane Sigil.

Additionally, if you spend 1 minute observing a portal or teleportation runes, you can make a DC 10 Spell Check to try to understand the inner mechanism of a Portal within 5 Spaces. **Success:** You learn where it leads to and for how long it has been open. **Success (5):** You learn how to activate and deactivate it (such as its passphrase, procedures, or any required special item).

#### Witch

**Coven's Gift**
You learn 1 Spell of your choice with the Curse Spell Tag. When you learn a new Spell, you can choose any Spell with the Curse Spell Tag. Spells with the Curse Spell Tag count as being part of your chosen Spell School for the purposes of your **Spell School Initiate** Feature.

**Hex Enhancements**
You can add the Spell Enhancements below to any Spell you cast, but you can only add 1 at a time. MP spent on these Spell Enhancements don't count against your Mana Spend Limit.

When you use one of these Spell Enhancements, 1 creature of your choice that's targeted by the Spell must make a Repeated Charisma Save against your Check. If the Spell doesn't normally require a Check, you must make a Spell Check when using one of these Spell Enhancements. **Save Failure:** The target is subjected to the chosen Hex for 1 minute:

- **Bewitching Hex:** (1 MP) The target becomes **Charmed** by you for the duration.
- **Reaping Hex:** (1 MP) The target takes 1 True damage and you regain 1 HP. This effect repeats at the end of each of its turns for the duration.
- **Vermin Hex:** (1 MP) The target can't speak and if its Size is Large or smaller its Size decreases by 1. Its Size decreases by 1 again at the end of each of its turns for the duration until it becomes Tiny.
  - **DC Tip:** You could flavor this as the target slowly turning into a toad or other tiny creature.

**Curse Expert (Flavor Feature)**
You can spend 1 minute focusing your mind to detect the presence of Curses within 20 Spaces. You learn the location of any Cursed creature or Cursed object within range. If you spend 10 minutes in contact with a Cursed creature or object, you learn the nature of the Curse but not the knowledge of how to remove it.

- **Invocation:** positive energy (life and spirit).
- **Nullification:** negative energy (destroy matter or spirit).
- **Transmutation:** Alteration of Physical (change form, shape, or matter).

**Removed Schools:**

- **Chronomancy** is now part of Astromancy, and is also represented by the Time Spell Tag.
- **Destruction** is now spread across Elemental (elemental damage), Invocation (radiant damage spells), Nullification (umbral damage spells), and Enchantment (psychic damage spells). It's also represented by several Spell Tags associated with Damage Types (i.e. Fire, Cold, Piercing, etc.).
- **Restoration** is now part of Invocation, which covers life energy. It's also represented by the Cleansing, Healing, and Resurrection Spell Tags.
- **Illusion**, **Necromancy**, and **Protection** have become Spell Tags that are added to Spells with associated effects.

**Components:**

- All Spells have Verbal and Somatic Components, unless stated otherwise. Specific Spells may have a Material Component.
- **Verbal Components:** Creatures that can hear you know you're casting a Spell if you have a Verbal Component.

**Advanced Spellcasting:**

- The rules for Spell Duels & Combo Casting have been rewritten to tie directly into each other to make it easier to adjudicate what happens when a Combo Casted spell is Spell Dueled.

### Equipment

**Weapon Styles:**

- Weapon Styles replace Save Maneuvers.
- A new Style has been added for Ranged Weapons: Sling (**Hinder**).

- +1 damage when fulfilling a condition have been replaced by Weapon Enhancements that can be added to any Weapon Attack by spending 1 AP or 1 SP.

  - **Sword:** changed from **Exposed** to adding a d4 to your Attack.
  - **Hammer:** changed from **Dazed** or **Petrified** to **Knockback**.

- Special properties category has been removed.
- **Returning** has become a normal property.
- **Capture** was removed, the net and bolas becoming a piece of equipment unrelated to weapons as the purpose of weapons is primarily to attack and this property was turning the weapon into a piece of gear with a different purpose.

**Spell Focuses:**

- Spell Focus are a new item that Spellcasters can use to cast Spells. These are not required for casting Spells, but add a small measure of depth to your Spellcasting. They function similar to a Martial's Weapon, where they can make Attacks on their own (using Unarmed Strikes) but a Weapon comes with Weapon Properties (Reach, Versatile, Impact, etc.). Similarly, a Spell Focus has Focus Properties that add benefits to a Spellcaster's Spell (Channeling, Warded, Reach, etc.).

**Misc:**

- First Aid Kit has been renamed to Medicine Kit and updated for how poisons will work in DC20.
- Net has been updated to work with the new throwing rules.

### Conditions

- **Poisoned** no longer a Condition, but it can still be referred to like other 'statuses' (status is not a game term) such as being Cursed, Diseased, Flanked, **Bloodied**, etc.

### Resting

- There's no longer a limitation on the number of Quick Rests you can take in a day.
- The **Exhaustion** rules of the Long Rest section have been updated to improve readability.

### Talents

**General Talents:**

  - No longer grants 1 Technique.
- **Spellcasting Expansion:**
  - Grants Combat Training with Focuses.
  - Lets you add 1 Spell Source or 3 Spell Schools to your Spell List, instead of choosing the Spell List of any Class.

- **Champion:**
  - **Disciplined Combatant:** Must spend 2 SP to gain the benefit of Combat Readiness instead of 1 SP.

  - **Draconic Breath Weapon** had damage numbers adjusted.
  - **Second Breath's** cost went up from 1 Ancestry Point to 2.
- **Beast Traits:**
  - **Body:** Secondary Arms, Prehensile Appendage, and Hazardous Hide removed. Replaced with **Additional Limb** and **Capable Limb**.

### Misc Changes

**Attack Maneuvers:**

- Attack Maneuvers are no longer a basic type of Maneuver that Martials immediately get access to all of. This has been replaced by Martial Enhancements. 'Attack Maneuver' has been replaced with 'Martial Enhancement' in many places that referenced them.
- Attack Maneuvers are their own type of Maneuvers now, with unique enhancements and more variety.

**Sonic Damage:**

- Removed from the game.
- **Issue:** Right now Sonic damage represents high frequency sound waves that cause pain in your ears (if you aren't deaf) and potentially damage unique creatures that are sensitive to high frequency vibrations (venom symbiote). This makes it a very niche form of damage.
- **Solution:** We can eliminate Sonic damage by changing how we frame high frequency attacks:
  - they force you to make a Save against being **Deafened**, **Dazed**, or something else.
  - they deal Bludgeoning if its part of a wave of force that hits you (explosion).
  - this type of attack may deal double damage (or just True damage) against objects and creatures sensitive to high frequency vibrations (glass and venom symbiote).
  - these things might instead have Vulnerable to damage from High Frequency Sound.
  - Internal damage would be True damage (organs and stuff).
- By framing things this way, Sonic damage no longer needs to exist, simplifying the number of damage types in the game.

**Rituals:**

- Rituals are no longer a Spell Tag. Instead, they are a group of activities (not Spells) that all PCs can learn and perform (Identify, Mending, etc.). The classic Alarm Spell is now a Ritual that can now be performed by a Martial who may just use their time performing the Ritual to set up a series of trip wires and bells to alert them of a nearby intruder.

- Combo Maneuvers have been added to allow Martials to combo their Maneuvers similar to how Spellcasters can combo their Spells.

### Maneuvers

**Removed Schools:**

- **Destruction** is now spread across Elemental (elemental damage), Invocation (radiant damage spells), Nullification (umbral damage spells), and Enchantment (psychic damage spells). It's also represented by several Spell Tags associated with Damage Types (i.e. Fire, Cold, Piercing, etc.).
- **Restoration** is now part of Invocation, which covers life energy. It's also represented by the Cleansing, Healing, and Resurrection Spell Tags.
- **Illusion**, **Necromancy**, and **Protection** have become Spell Tags that are added to Spells with associated effects.

**Components:**

- All Spells have Verbal and Somatic Components, unless stated otherwise. Specific Spells may have a Material Component.
- **Verbal Components:** Creatures that can hear you know you're casting a Spell if you have a Verbal Component.

**Advanced Spellcasting:**

- The rules for Spell Duels & Combo Casting have been rewritten to tie directly into each other to make it easier to adjudicate what happens when a Combo Casted spell is Spell Dueled.

### Equipment

**Weapon Styles:**

- Weapon Styles replace Save Maneuvers.
- A new Style has been added for Ranged Weapons: Sling (**Hinder**).

- +1 damage when fulfilling a condition have been replaced by Weapon Enhancements that can be added to any Weapon Attack by spending 1 AP or 1 SP.

  - **Sword:** changed from **Exposed** to adding a d4 to your Attack.
  - **Hammer:** changed from **Dazed** or **Petrified** to **Knockback**.

- Special properties category has been removed.
- **Returning** has become a normal property.
- **Capture** was removed, the net and bolas becoming a piece of equipment unrelated to weapons as the purpose of weapons is primarily to attack and this property was turning the weapon into a piece of gear with a different purpose.

**Spell Focuses:**

- Spell Focus are a new item that Spellcasters can use to cast Spells. These are not required for casting Spells, but add a small measure of depth to your Spellcasting. They function similar to a Martial's Weapon, where they can make Attacks on their own (using Unarmed Strikes) but a Weapon comes with Weapon Properties (Reach, Versatile, Impact, etc.). Similarly, a Spell Focus has Focus Properties that add benefits to a Spellcaster's Spell (Channeling, Warded, Reach, etc.).

**Misc:**

- First Aid Kit has been renamed to Medicine Kit and updated for how poisons will work in DC20.
- Net has been updated to work with the new throwing rules.

- **Beast Traits:**
  - **Body:** Secondary Arms, Prehensile Appendage, and Hazardous Hide removed. Replaced with **Additional Limb** and **Capable Limb**.

### Misc Changes

**Attack Maneuvers:**

- Attack Maneuvers are no longer a basic type of Maneuver that Martials immediately get access to all of. This has been replaced by Martial Enhancements. 'Attack Maneuver' has been replaced with 'Martial Enhancement' in many places that referenced them.
- Attack Maneuvers are their own type of Maneuvers now, with unique enhancements and more variety.

**Sonic Damage:**

- Removed from the game.
- **Issue:** Right now Sonic damage represents high frequency sound waves that cause pain in your ears (if you aren't deaf) and potentially damage unique creatures that are sensitive to high frequency vibrations (venom symbiote). This makes it a very niche form of damage.
- **Solution:** We can eliminate Sonic damage by changing how we frame high frequency attacks:
  - they force you to make a Save against being **Deafened**, **Dazed**, or something else.
  - they deal Bludgeoning if its part of a wave of force that hits you (explosion).
  - this type of attack may deal double damage (or just True damage) against objects and creatures sensitive to high frequency vibrations (glass and venom symbiote).
  - these things might instead have Vulnerable to damage from High Frequency Sound.
  - Internal damage would be True damage (organs and stuff).
- By framing things this way, Sonic damage no longer needs to exist, simplifying the number of damage types in the game.

**Rituals:**

- Rituals are no longer a Spell Tag. Instead, they are a group of activities (not Spells) that all PCs can learn and perform (Identify, Mending, etc.). The classic Alarm Spell is now a Ritual that can now be performed by a Martial who may just use their time performing the Ritual to set up a series of trip wires and bells to alert them of a nearby intruder.
