## ‚úÖ COMPLETED ITEMS

### 0. Epic: Persist mastery/totals on character ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

**Status:** Fully implemented

**Deliverables:** All complete
- ‚úÖ `denormalizeMastery.ts` service created
- ‚úÖ Types defined in `dataContracts.ts`
- ‚úÖ Integration in `characterCompletion.ts`
- ‚úÖ PDF transformer uses denormalized fields
- ‚úÖ For each skill and trade: governingAttributes, baseAttributeValues, masteryLevel, masteryLadder, finalValue
- ‚úÖ Knowledge trades: ladder/finalValue with Intelligence attributes
- ‚úÖ Practical trades A-D: { label, ladder, finalValue }
- ‚úÖ Languages: `languageMastery` A-D = { name, limited, fluent }

**Evidence:**
- File: `src/lib/services/denormalizeMastery.ts` (205 lines)
- File: `src/lib/services/denormalizeMastery.spec.ts` (73 lines of tests)
- Integration: `characterCompletion.ts` lines 14, 67, 146-150
- PDF: `transformers.ts` consumes denormalized fields

**Acceptance:**
- ‚úÖ Local export PDF matches UI for skills/trades/languages
- ‚úÖ No regressions in Character Sheet rendering

---

### 3. PDF Export and Calculation Follow-ups ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

#### ‚úÖ Rest Points Cap
- **Status:** Implemented
- Rest points equal final HP Max (verified in calculator)

#### ‚úÖ Character Schema Extension
- **Status:** Schema extended in `dataContracts.ts` (lines 125-132)
- Fields added:
  - `finalPDHeavyThreshold`, `finalPDBrutalThreshold`
  - `finalADHeavyThreshold`, `finalADBrutalThreshold`
  - `bloodiedValue`, `wellBloodiedValue`
- **Note:** Thresholds are computed in `characterCompletion.ts` as needed

#### ‚úÖ Attribute Save Values
- **Status:** Verified correct
- Formula: `attribute + combat mastery` (implemented in calculator)

## üöß REMAINING ITEMS

### 1. Flesh out Unit Tests for Core Logic ‚ùå **NOT STARTED**

**Current gap:**
- Placeholder test files exist but contain only `expect(true).toBe(true)`
- Core utilities and hooks lack meaningful test coverage

**Files needing real tests:**
- `src/lib/utils/defenseNotes.spec.ts` - Currently 7 lines, needs ~50-100 lines
- `src/lib/services/spellAssignment.spec.ts` - Currently 7 lines, needs ~100-150 lines
- `src/lib/hooks/useEnhancedCharacterCalculation.spec.ts` - Currently 7 lines, needs ~80-120 lines

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Tests cover primary functions, edge cases, and invalid inputs
- `npm run test:unit` passes with meaningful coverage increase

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write tests for `defenseNotes.ts` utilities (get, add, update, delete notes)
- [ ] Write tests for `spellAssignment.ts` service (class spell assignment logic)
- [ ] Write tests for `useEnhancedCharacterCalculation.ts` hook (requires mocking context)

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### 2. Low-Priority System Docs ‚è∏Ô∏è **DEFERRED**

**Tracked for future work:**
- Weapons & Items System ‚Äî items schema, weapon damage derivation, UI interactions
- Currency System ‚Äî model, validation, persistence, UI mapping
- Status & Exhaustion System ‚Äî levels, effects, modal behavior
- Persistence & API ‚Äî save/load mapping, Prisma schema, API contract

**Note:** Current focus is on the newly added Spells, Martials, Calculation, Effect docs, and Character Sheet overview.

---

### 4. FE Ticket: Move UI calculations to character data ‚ùå **NOT STARTED**

**Goal:** Remove all derived-calculation logic from UI components; consume precomputed values on `SavedCharacter` instead.

**Context (backend COMPLETE):**
- ‚úÖ `SavedCharacter` persists denormalized background data
- ‚úÖ PDF transformer already uses these fields
- ‚ùå Frontend UI still recomputes values from raw data

**Scope for FE migration:**
- [ ] Skills: Read `skillTotals` (and `skillMastery` for tooltips) instead of recomputing from `skillsData`
- [ ] Mastery ladders: Render from `masteryLadders.skills`, `masteryLadders.knowledgeTrades`, `masteryLadders.practicalTrades`
- [ ] Trade labels: Use `masteryLadders.practicalTrades.{A..D}.label`
- [ ] Languages: Use `languageMastery` A-D for Limited/Fluent display
- [ ] Defenses/bloodied: Display `finalPD/AD` thresholds and `bloodiedValue`/`wellBloodiedValue` directly
- [ ] Remove character sheet recalculation on load (trust stored data)

**Files to update:**
- `src/routes/character-sheet/hooks/CharacterSheetProvider.tsx` - Remove `calculateCharacterWithBreakdowns` on load
- All character sheet components that display skills/trades/languages
- Defense display components

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] No UI behavior changes; rendered values equal before/after migration
- [ ] `CharacterSheetProvider.tsx` does NOT recalculate on load
- [ ] PDF transformer contains zero math (only mapping from `SavedCharacter`)
- [ ] Unit tests cover consumption of new fields and graceful fallback

**Estimated effort:** 8-12 hours

---

### 6. Expand Multiclass Talent Selection ‚ùå **NOT STARTED**

**Goal:** Allow selecting the same multiclass talent tier multiple times for different classes (e.g., Novice Multiclass twice to get Level 1 features from two different classes).

**Current limitation:**
- Multiclass talents are stored as single-select in `selectedTalents: Record<string, number>`
- Each tier (Novice, Adept, Expert, etc.) can only be taken once
- Cannot multiclass into multiple classes at the same tier level

**Proposed solution:**
- Change multiclass talent storage from count-based to instance-based
- New structure: `multiclassSelections: Array<{ tierId: string, classId: string, featureId: string }>`
- Each selection stores: which tier, which class, which feature
- Allow multiple instances of same tier pointing to different classes

**Example use case:**
- Level 4 character with 2 talent points
- Take "Novice Multiclass" ‚Üí select Barbarian ‚Üí get "Rage" (Level 1)
- Take "Novice Multiclass" again ‚Üí select Wizard ‚Üí get "Spell School Initiate" (Level 1)
- Result: Character has features from 2 different multiclass sources

**Implementation tasks:**
- [ ] Update `multiclassSelections` type in `characterContext.tsx` and `effectSystem.ts`
- [ ] Modify `LevelingChoices.tsx` multiclass UI to support multiple instances per tier
- [ ] Update calculator to process array of multiclass selections (not just single tier flags)
- [ ] Add validation: same tier + class combo cannot be selected twice
- [ ] Update persistence in `characterCompletion.ts` and `dataContracts.ts`
- [ ] Update talent budget counting to handle multiclass instances correctly
- [ ] Add unit tests for multiple multiclass selection scenarios
- [ ] Update LEVELING_SYSTEM.MD with multiclass instance rules

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Can select same multiclass tier multiple times if pointing to different classes
- [ ] Each selection correctly applies effects from chosen feature
- [ ] Talent budget properly decrements for each multiclass selection
- [ ] Cannot select same tier + class combination twice
- [ ] Multiclass selections persist correctly on save/load
- [ ] UI clearly shows which classes have been multiclassed at which tiers

**Dependencies:**
- M3.17 (Complete Multiclass Talent System) ‚úÖ Done
- Current multiclass system fully implemented

**Estimated effort:** 6-8 hours

## üìã ADDITIONAL TASKS (from analysis)

### 5. Extract useAttributeCalculation Hook üü° **OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENT**

**Current state:**
- Attribute calculation logic is inline in `Attributes.tsx`
- Works correctly but not following original architectural plan

**Proposed:**
- Extract to `src/lib/hooks/useAttributeCalculation.ts`
- Improves testability and reusability
- Matches DATA_FLOW_REFACTOR architectural design

**Priority:** Low (current implementation works)
**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours

**Overall: 2 of 5 active tasks complete (40%)**

## üéØ Recommended Priority Order

1. **HIGH:** FE Migration (Section 4) - Biggest architectural impact, removes duplicate logic
2. **MEDIUM:** Multiclass Expansion (Section 6) - Extends leveling system flexibility, builds on M3.17
3. **MEDIUM:** Unit Tests (Section 1) - Protects against regressions
4. **LOW:** Extract Hook (Section 5) - Nice to have, current code works
