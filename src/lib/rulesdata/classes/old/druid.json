You can spend 1 AP on your turn to shift back and forth between your True Form and any Wild Forms you currently have available. Once per Long Rest, you can transform without spending MP or using MP enhancements. True Form: When you transform from your Wild Form to your True Form, your statistics return to normal. You immediately revert to your True Form when your Wild Form HP is reduced to 0 or you die. Wild Form: When you transform into a Wild Form, you gain the Wild Form’s current Wild Form HP (see Wild Form HP below), retaining any HP losses. Duration: Each Wild Form remains available until its Wild Form HP is reduced to 0 or you complete a Long Rest. Multiple Forms: You can have multiple Wild Forms available at a time which have their own Wild Form HP and Traits. Equipment: Your equipment falls to the ground or merges into your Wild Form (your choice for each item). You gain the benefits of Magic Items merged with your Wild Form, but you can’t activate them or spend their charges. Statistics: While in your Wild Form, you’re subjected to the following changes (unless otherwise stated): Stat Block: You use the Wild Form Stat Block below to determine your statistics. Identity: You maintain your personality, intellect, and ability to speak. Wild Form HP: You gain a secondary pool of Wild Form Health Points, which is 3 with a maximum of 3. Damage and healing effects target your Wild Form HP before your True Form HP, and any excess damage or healing carries over to your own HP. Natural Weapon: You have Natural Weapons (claws, horns, fangs, etc.) which you can use to make Unarmed Strikes that deal 1 Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage (your choice when you use this Feature). Features & Talents: You don’t benefit from Talents or Class Features, except Druid Class Features, Subclass Features, and Talents. Additionally, you can’t cast Spells or perform Techniques. Traits: You don’t benefit from your Ancestry Traits, but you gain 3 Trait Points to spend on Beast Traits or Wild Form Traits of your choice. You can’t select negative Beast Traits. When you use this Feature, you can spend additional MP (up to your Mana Spend Limit) to gain 2 additional Trait Points per MP spent.",
