# DC20Clean – Conditions System Specification

> **Purpose**  
> To create a comprehensive, character-specific conditions tracking system that aggregates condition interactions (immunities, resistances, vulnerabilities) from all character sources (ancestry, class, subclass, talents, features) and displays them in a dedicated character sheet section.

---

## 1. Vision & Goals

**1.1. Core Objective**

Provide players with a complete, at-a-glance view of how their character interacts with every DC20 condition, eliminating the need to manually track feature interactions during gameplay.

**1.2. Success Criteria**

- Every character has a calculated `CharacterConditionStatus[]` array covering all 27 DC20 conditions
- All ancestry traits, class features, subclass features, and talents that grant condition interactions are automatically detected and aggregated
- A new "Conditions" section in the character sheet displays all conditions with which the character has special interactions
- The system integrates seamlessly with the existing Effect System

**1.3. Value Proposition**

When a GM calls for a save against Frightened, the player immediately knows they have "Frightened Resistance (ADV on saves)" from their Dwarf ancestry trait, without searching through multiple feature descriptions.

---

## 2. Data Architecture

### 2.1. Existing Foundation

**Current Files:**
- `src/lib/rulesdata/conditions/conditions.types.ts` – Type definitions for conditions ✅
- `src/lib/rulesdata/conditions/conditions.data.ts` – Complete list of 27 DC20 conditions ✅

**Key Types (Already Defined):**

```typescript
// Condition behavior types
type ConditionType = 'stacking' | 'overlapping' | 'absolute';

// Condition interaction types (as per DC20 rules)
type ConditionInteractionType = 'immunity' | 'resistance' | 'vulnerability';

// Character's interaction with a specific condition
interface ConditionInteraction {
  type: ConditionInteractionType;
  source: string; // e.g., "Barbarian: Iron Mind (Level 7)"
  details?: string; // e.g., "Only while Raging"
}

// Character's complete status for one condition
interface CharacterConditionStatus {
  conditionId: string; // References ConditionDefinition.id
  interactions: ConditionInteraction[]; // Can have multiple sources
}
```

### 2.2. Integration with Effect System

**New Effect Types** (to be added to `src/lib/rulesdata/schemas/character.schema.ts`):

```typescript
// Condition interaction effects
{
  type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_IMMUNITY';
  target: string; // condition ID (e.g., 'frightened', 'charmed')
  value: true;
  details?: string; // optional contextual note
}

{
  type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE';
  target: string; // condition ID
  value: 'ADV'; // or 'ADV_2' for stacking
  details?: string;
}

{
  type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_VULNERABILITY';
  target: string; // condition ID
  value: 'DisADV';
  details?: string;
}
```

**Mapping DC20 Rules to System:**
- **Condition Immunity** → `GRANT_CONDITION_IMMUNITY` (can't be subjected to condition)
- **Condition Resistance** → `GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE` (ADV on checks/saves against condition)
- **Condition Vulnerability** → `GRANT_CONDITION_VULNERABILITY` (DisADV on checks/saves against condition)

---

## 3. Feature Scanning & Aggregation

### 3.1. Source Feature Audit

**Goal:** Identify and catalog every feature across the codebase that provides condition interactions.

**Data Sources to Scan:**
1. `src/lib/rulesdata/ancestries/traits.ts` – Ancestry traits
2. `src/lib/rulesdata/classes-data/features/*_features.ts` – Class & subclass features
3. `src/lib/rulesdata/classes-data/talents/*.talents.ts` – Class talents
4. `src/lib/rulesdata/paths/` – Character path abilities (if applicable)

**Example Mappings:**

| Source | Feature | Condition Interaction | Effect Representation |
|--------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Human Trait | Undying | Resistance to Doomed | `{ type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE', target: 'doomed-x', value: 'ADV' }` |
| Barbarian Level 1 | Rage | ADV on Might Saves (relates to multiple conditions) | Requires breakdown: affects Weakened-X, Restrained, Paralyzed saves |
| Paladin Subclass | Divine Presence | Immunity to Frightened | `{ type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_IMMUNITY', target: 'frightened', value: true }` |
| Elf Trait | Fey Ancestry | Resistance to Charmed | `{ type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE', target: 'charmed', value: 'ADV' }` |

**Special Cases:**

- **Stat-based saves** (e.g., "ADV on Might Saves"): Must be expanded to list affected conditions:
  - Might Saves relate to: Weakened-X, Restrained, Paralyzed, Petrified, etc.
  - Implementation: Create helper function `getConditionsAffectedByAttribute(attribute: string): string[]`

- **Conditional interactions** (e.g., "While Raging"):
  - Store in `details` field: `"Only while Raging"`
  - UI displays with context indicator

### 3.2. Refactoring Existing Features

**Phase 1: Explicit Condition References**

Update features that currently use text-only descriptions to include structured condition effects.

**Before:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'human_undying',
  name: 'Undying',
  description: 'You have ADV on Saves against the Doomed Condition.',
  cost: 0,
  effects: [{ type: 'GRANT_ADV_ON_SAVE', target: 'Doomed', value: 'ADV' }]
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'human_undying',
  name: 'Undying',
  description: 'You have ADV on Saves against the Doomed Condition.',
  cost: 0,
  effects: [
    { type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE', target: 'doomed-x', value: 'ADV' }
  ]
}
```

**Phase 2: Implicit Condition References**

Expand save-based advantages to explicit condition lists.

**Before:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'barbarian_rage',
  featureName: 'Rage',
  description: 'ADV on Might Saves...',
  effects: [
    { 
      type: 'GRANT_ABILITY',
      target: 'rage',
      value: 'ADV on Might Saves, ...'
    }
  ]
}
```

**After (expanded):**
```typescript
{
  id: 'barbarian_rage',
  featureName: 'Rage',
  description: 'ADV on Might Saves...',
  effects: [
    { type: 'GRANT_ABILITY', target: 'rage', value: '...' },
    // Expanded condition interactions
    { type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE', target: 'weakened-x', value: 'ADV', details: 'While Raging' },
    { type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE', target: 'restrained', value: 'ADV', details: 'While Raging' },
    { type: 'GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE', target: 'paralyzed', value: 'ADV', details: 'While Raging' },
    // ... etc for all Might Save conditions
  ]
}
```

## 4. Calculation Engine Integration

### 4.1. New Service: Condition Aggregator

**File:** `src/lib/services/conditionAggregator.ts`

**Primary Function:**
```typescript
/**
 * Aggregates all condition interactions for a character
 * @param character - The character data with selected features
 * @returns Array of condition statuses covering all 27 DC20 conditions
 */
export function calculateCharacterConditions(
  character: CharacterData
): CharacterConditionStatus[] {
  const interactions = new Map<string, ConditionInteraction[]>();
  
  // 1. Start with all conditions (empty interactions)
  ALL_CONDITIONS.forEach(condition => {
    interactions.set(condition.id, []);
  });
  
  // 2. Scan ancestry traits
  character.selectedTraits?.forEach(trait => {
    processConditionEffects(trait.effects, trait.name, 'Ancestry', interactions);
  });
  
  // 3. Scan class features (up to character level)
  const classFeatures = getClassFeaturesUpToLevel(character.className, character.level);
  classFeatures.forEach(feature => {
    processConditionEffects(feature.effects, feature.featureName, 'Class', interactions);
  });
  
  // 4. Scan subclass features
  if (character.subclass) {
    const subclassFeatures = getSubclassFeaturesUpToLevel(
      character.className,
      character.subclass,
      character.level
    );
    subclassFeatures.forEach(feature => {
      processConditionEffects(feature.effects, feature.featureName, 'Subclass', interactions);
    });
  }
  
  // 5. Scan selected talents
  character.selectedTalents?.forEach(talent => {
    processConditionEffects(talent.effects, talent.name, 'Talent', interactions);
  });
  
  // 6. Convert map to CharacterConditionStatus array
  return Array.from(interactions.entries()).map(([conditionId, interactionList]) => ({
    conditionId,
    interactions: interactionList
  }));
}
```

**Helper Function:**
```typescript
function processConditionEffects(
  effects: Effect[],
  sourceName: string,
  sourceCategory: string,
  interactions: Map<string, ConditionInteraction[]>
): void {
  effects.forEach(effect => {
    if (
      effect.type === 'GRANT_CONDITION_IMMUNITY' ||
      effect.type === 'GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE' ||
      effect.type === 'GRANT_CONDITION_VULNERABILITY'
    ) {
      const conditionId = effect.target;
      const existingInteractions = interactions.get(conditionId) || [];
      
      existingInteractions.push({
        type: effect.type.replace('GRANT_CONDITION_', '').toLowerCase() as ConditionInteractionType,
        source: `${sourceCategory}: ${sourceName}`,
        details: effect.details
      });
      
      interactions.set(conditionId, existingInteractions);
    }
  });
}
```

### 4.2. Integration with Character Calculator

**File:** `src/lib/services/enhancedCharacterCalculator.ts`

**Update:** Add conditions to calculation result

```typescript
export interface EnhancedCalculationResult {
  // ... existing fields
  conditions: CharacterConditionStatus[]; // NEW
}

export function calculateCharacterWithBreakdowns(
  character: CharacterData
): EnhancedCalculationResult {
  // ... existing calculation logic
  
  const conditions = calculateCharacterConditions(character);
  
  return {
    // ... existing fields
    conditions
  };
}
```

## 5. UI/UX Design

### 5.1. Character Sheet Section

**Location:** New section in character sheet, displayed alongside Features

**Component:** `src/routes/character-sheet/components/Conditions.tsx`

**Visual Design:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🛡️ Condition Interactions               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                          │

│  conditions without modifiers]           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Grouped by interaction type** – Immunities, Resistances, Vulnerabilities displayed prominently
2. **Source attribution** – Every interaction shows which feature grants it
3. **Contextual details** – Conditional interactions (e.g., "While Raging") clearly marked
4. **Expandable full list** – Shows all 27 conditions, marking those without interactions as "None"
5. **Search/Filter** – Quick filter to find specific conditions
6. **Info buttons** – Click condition name to see full DC20 rules description

### 5.2. Component Structure

```typescript
interface ConditionsProps {
  conditionStatuses: CharacterConditionStatus[];
  isMobile?: boolean;
}

const Conditions: React.FC<ConditionsProps> = ({ conditionStatuses, isMobile }) => {
  const [expandedView, setExpandedView] = useState(false);
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
  
  // Separate conditions by interaction type
  const immunities = conditionStatuses.filter(cs => 
    cs.interactions.some(i => i.type === 'immunity')
  );
  
  const resistances = conditionStatuses.filter(cs =>
    cs.interactions.some(i => i.type === 'resistance')
  );
  
  const vulnerabilities = conditionStatuses.filter(cs =>
    cs.interactions.some(i => i.type === 'vulnerability')
  );
  
  const noInteractions = conditionStatuses.filter(cs =>
    cs.interactions.length === 0
  );
  
  // ... rendering logic
};
```

### 5.3. Mobile Considerations

- Collapsible sections by default on mobile
- "Quick View" showing only conditions with interactions
- Swipe-to-reveal full condition descriptions
- Add to existing "Info" tab in mobile character sheet

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: Data Completeness
- [ ] All 27 DC20 conditions defined in `conditions.data.ts`
- [ ] Every condition has `id`, `name`, `description`, `type`, `tags`
- [ ] Condition IDs match DC20 naming (e.g., `bleeding-x`, `frightened`)

### AC-2: Feature Coverage
- [ ] 100% of condition-granting features identified and cataloged
- [ ] All ancestry traits with condition interactions use structured effects
- [ ] All class features with condition interactions use structured effects
- [ ] All talents with condition interactions use structured effects

### AC-3: Calculation Accuracy
Given a character with:
- Human Ancestry (Undying trait → Doomed Resistance)
- Barbarian Level 1 (Rage → ADV on Might Saves)
- Elf Heritage (Fey Ancestry → Charmed Resistance)

Then `calculationResult.conditions` contains:
- `doomed-x`: 1 resistance interaction (Human: Undying)
- `charmed`: 1 resistance interaction (Elf: Fey Ancestry)
- `weakened-x`: 1 resistance interaction (Barbarian: Rage, "While Raging")
- `restrained`: 1 resistance interaction (Barbarian: Rage, "While Raging")
- ... (all Might Save conditions)
- All other conditions: 0 interactions

### AC-4: UI Functionality
- [ ] Conditions section visible in character sheet (desktop & mobile)
- [ ] Conditions grouped by type (immunities/resistances/vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Source attribution displayed for each interaction
- [ ] Conditional details (e.g., "While Raging") clearly marked
- [ ] Search/filter finds conditions by name
- [ ] Clicking condition name opens full DC20 description
- [ ] "No special interaction" displayed for unaffected conditions (in expanded view)

### AC-5: E2E Validation
- [ ] `e2e/13-conditions.e2e.spec.ts` passes
- [ ] Human Cleric test character shows expected condition interactions
- [ ] Hunter Beastborn test character shows expected condition interactions
- [ ] Mobile layout displays conditions correctly

## 9. Dependencies & Constraints

### Dependencies
- **Effect System** (`docs/systems/EFFECT_SYSTEM.MD`) – Must support new condition effect types
- **Calculation System** (`docs/systems/CALCULATION_SYSTEM.MD`) – Must integrate condition aggregation
- **Class System** (`docs/systems/CLASS_SYSTEM.MD`) – Features must use structured effects
- **Ancestry System** (`docs/systems/ANCESTRY_SYSTEM.MD`) – Traits must use structured effects

### Constraints
- **No Schema Migrations** – Use existing `Effect` type union, extend with new types
- **Backward Compatibility** – Existing characters without condition data default to empty interactions
- **Performance** – Condition calculation must not exceed 50ms for character with 20 features
- **Mobile-First** – Conditions UI must be usable on 375px viewport

---

## 10. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- **Active Condition Tracking** – Track currently applied conditions during combat (separate feature)
- **Condition Stacking Calculator** – Calculate current Exhaustion X / Stunned X values
- **Homebrew Conditions** – Allow users to define custom conditions
- **Condition Automation** – Auto-apply condition effects to rolls (requires VTT integration)
- **Condition Presets** – "Common Combat Conditions" quick reference panel

---

## 11. Troubleshooting & FAQs

### Q: How do we handle features that give ADV on saves for an attribute (e.g., "ADV on Might Saves")?

**A:** Create a mapping helper `getConditionsAffectedByAttribute()` that returns all conditions resisted by that save type. Expand the single effect into multiple `GRANT_CONDITION_RESISTANCE` effects, one per affected condition. Mark each with `details: "While [condition applies]"` if contextual.

### Q: What if multiple sources grant the same condition interaction?

**A:** Store all sources in the `interactions[]` array. UI displays as:
```
Frightened
├─ Immunity - Paladin: Aura of Courage (Level 7)
└─ Immunity - Feat: Fearless Heart
```

Mechanically, one immunity is sufficient, but showing all sources helps players understand their character.

### Q: How do we handle conditional interactions (e.g., "Only while Raging")?

**A:** Use the `details` field in `ConditionInteraction`:
```typescript
{
  type: 'resistance',
  source: 'Barbarian: Rage',
  details: 'While Raging'
}
```

UI displays: `✨ ADV on saves (While Raging) - Barbarian: Rage`

### Q: Should we show conditions with no interactions in the main view?

**A:** No. Default view shows only conditions with interactions (immunities/resistances/vulnerabilities). Provide an "Expand All Conditions" toggle to show the complete list with "No special interaction" markers for thoroughness.

## 12. Agent Execution Notes

For AI agents implementing this spec:

1. **Start with Phase 2.1** (Feature Audit) – Create the audit script first to understand scope
2. **Follow HR checkpoints** – Do not proceed past HR-1, HR-2, HR-3 without explicit approval
3. **Maintain ID stability** – Do not change existing feature IDs; only add new effects
4. **Write tests first** – TDD approach for condition aggregator (Phase 3.1)
5. **Preserve existing UI** – Conditions section should not disrupt current character sheet layout
6. **Document as you go** – Update JSDoc comments with every function implementation
